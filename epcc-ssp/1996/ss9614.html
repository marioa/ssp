<H1>
Parallel processing of a 3-D BPM algorithm for nonlinear optoelectronic device modelling
</H1>

<p>

This project will extend work already done with EPCC to implement a
3-D finite-difference beam-propagation algorithm in
parallel-processing machines.  The purpose of the algorithm is to
model the propagation of electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies
in guided-wave devices which may contain nonlinear interactions with
the dielectric materials of the waveguide.  The BPM is based on a
paraxial reduction of the scalar wave equation, so that a parabolic
PDE is generated which can be represented as a Hamiltonian evolution
equation.  The algorithm has already been thoroughly tested on the
EPCC Connection Machine CM-200 and on a 64-transputer cluster in
Glasgow.  The aims of the project would be, first, to run the code on
the Cray at EPCC and calibrate its performance and, second, to
investigate boundary conditions transverse to the direction of
paraxial propagation which correctly simulate the radiation of EM
energy away from the axis of the structure into the open space
surrounding the guided-wave device.  There are two categories of
device which it is desired to model in this programme: optical
guided-wave devices undergoing second-harmonic generation,and
microwave co-planar transmission lines supporting KdV-like solitons.
In both cases the devices are expected to be many thousands of
wavelengths in length along the paraxial propagation direction, and
parallel processing is essential to model devices in reasonable
execution times.  The programmes for this project already exist and
have been run on parallel processing machines, including the CM-200 at
EPCC.  The workplan would therefore consist of: familiarisation with
existing code (if necessary) (2 weeks); porting the code onto the Cray
T3D (2 weeks); calibrating its performance on benchmark problems (2
weeks); studying the implementation in the parallel environment of
various strategies for the imposition of radiative boundary conditions
(2 weeks, or 4 weeks if the familiarisation phase is not required by a
student who already knows the code).

<h3>Resources</h3>

Cray T3D at EPCC with remote operation via network from Glasgow if
desired.

<h3>Resources supplied</h3>

Working codes in FORTRAN 77/PARIX and CM-FORTRAN. Version of serial
code in C should be available by 1 July, parallel C version may
possibly have been run on Glasgow Parsytec cluster.
