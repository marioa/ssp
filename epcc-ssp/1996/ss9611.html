Parallel Vector-topological data input for Geographical Informations Systems
</H1>

<p>

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) permit the storage, display and
manipulation of spatially referenced data. Continued rapid growth in the
availability of digital cartographic data and satellite images is creating
a demand for intensive computing to integrate and process large
datasets. Such datasets can be collected and integrated from a wide variety
of sources, including geological, political and census databases. This
information can then be used to solve problems in areas such as
environmental assessment, transportation, marketing, distribution,
telecommunications, planning and resource management.

<p>

GIS processing is both computationally and I/O intensive. This makes GIS an
ideal application for parallel processing, where performance and I/O can be
increased in a modular and scalable way. Consequently the Edinburgh
Parallel Computing Centre, in partnership with the Department of Geography,
has developed GIS systems that exploit parallel processing technology.

<p>

A scalable, extensible, parallel library of core GIS operations has been
designed and partly implemented to interface to some of the major
commercial GIS packages.  These core operations are polygon
overlay, and conversion between raster and vector data formats.

<p>

These core operations have been designed in a modular fashion enabling the
substantial reuse of code segments. Full parallel designs have been
produced for all components of all operations.   

<p>

The vector data input module performs the pre-processing and distribution
of vector data necessary for both the polygon overlay and vector-to-raster
conversion operations.  Indeed similar processing and distribution of
vector data is required by most vector GIS operations.  This module is
therefore an important building block for parallel GIS operations other
than just polygon overlay and vector-to-raster conversion operations.  It
also necessary for operations such as vector topology creation, buffer
generation and generalisation.

<p>

The vector data input module comprises three sub-phases :

<ul>
  <li> <b>Sort</b> This extracts the data necessary for the operations
       from the input datasets.  This data is then processed and sorted before
       output to PUL-PF files.
  <li> <b>Join</b> The data output by Sort are merge-sorted and combined.
  <li> <b>Geom Attribute Distribution (GAD)</b> This takes the data out by
       Join and decomposes and distributes to Worker processes for Polygon
       Overlay or Vector-to-Raster conversion.
</ul>
        
All three sub-phases involve parallel processing of GIS data.  The
Sort Phase has been designed and implemented using MPI and PUL-GF.
The Join Phase has been implemented using CHIMP.  Both these modules
have been tested.  Detailed design documents and pseudo-code also
exist.  All code is written in C.  A summer student project would
assist greatly in completing the implementation of the vector data
input module.

<p>
        
The designs for this work are about to be published in a Taylor and
Francis book, so this would represent a useful test of this work and
as such is publishable.  Last year's SSP is referenced and the results
quoted in this text.

<p>
        
Last year, an SSP student redesigned the Sort phase of the Vector Data
input module to use MPI instead of CHIMP.  This was implemented and
tested successfully.

<p>

The proposal for this year's project is to redesign and implement the
Join and GAD phases for MPI instead of CHIMP.  An implementation of
the Join phase with CHIMP currently exists and has been tested
successfully.  This first task is therefore a useful introduction to
the GIS the project and MPI since essentially that is required is the
reimplementation of the message passing code in Join.  The second task
requires much more effort since only a design (with pseudo-code) of
the GAD phase using CHIMP exists.  However this task uses much of the
functionality previously implemented in the Sort and Join phases and
therefore should be straightforward.

<p>

The project therefore consists of the following units.

<ul>
  <li> MPI training and familiarisation with parallel GIS project and
       its coding conventions.  (1 week)
  <li> Redesign and modify existing Join phase code to use MPI instead
       of CHIMP. (2 weeks)
  <li> Integrate Sort and Join phases and test. (1 week)
  <li> Redesign GAD phase message passing using MPI instead of CHIMP.
       (1 week)
  <li> Implement redesigned GAD sub-phase.  This reuses much of the
       functionality present in the Sort and Join codes.  (3 weeks)
  <li> Integrate Sort, Join and GAD phases and test. (1 week)
  <li> Write final report.  (1 week)
</ul>

Should the student complete the above, there is further work in
converting the Sort phase from PUL-GF and the implementation of a
parallel line intersection operation which utilises the complete
Vector Input module.
        
<h3>Expertise Required</h3>

Strong computing skills, preferably with C.

<h3>Resources Required</h3>
  
MPI, PUL-active buffers are used in the Join phase; the project no
longers requires PUL-PF; any necessary datasets can be obtained from
Geography dept.
  
<h3>Resources Supplied</h3>

Design documents plus existing code; datasets from Dept of Geography
