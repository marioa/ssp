<P>
There are various data import modules available in Explorer.
All the maps that have been provided for your use 
(called <em>Meson</em> and <em>Gauge</em>)
use the module <tt>ReadQCD</tt> to read in data.
This will read in data which has been
through the <tt>convert</tt> program and has had dimensions 
added at the top of the file
(see section <A HREF=subsection3_4_6.html#sectshell>4.6</A> on <em>shell scripts</em>).
<P>
There are however, other data import modules. These can be found 
in the category on the far left of the Librarian, most of them 
are called <tt>Read????</tt>. Alternatively the user can create their
own import module. There is a package called <tt>dcsribe</tt>
which is available to help you do this. To start dscribe type:
<P>
<tt>dscribe &</tt>
<P>
The explorer manual <A HREF=bibliography3_10.html#helenmanualexplorermodules>[3]</A> and 
<A HREF=bibliography3_10.html#helenmanualexplorerusers>[4]</A> (see section 7) 
has details of how to use this. When creating modules using dscribe
it is recommended to load up a data import module that 
has already been written , save it in your own directory 
under a new name, and alter it. It is also advised to  parse
(option found in the <tt>File</tt> menu in <tt>dscribe</tt>) the 
file after each alteration to pick up any errors. To test the module
try creating a small test data file of the same form.
This will save 
Explorer from <em>hanging</em> on you, or dumping the modules, 
sometimes causing errors in Explorer which make it necessary 
to <tt>Quit</tt> and restart.
