Four dimensional spacetime datasets are created by the 
UKQCD group using a Monte Carlo method.
These sets of data describe how
gluons 
interact with each other. From these datasets various 
physical properties can be calculated, some of which will be 
mentioned later. The fact that 
these data sets are four dimensional complicates the 
visualisation. Because of this most existing visualisation occurs in the 
form of one dimensional graphs representing the evolution of a 
physical property with time. However this does not take full 
advantage of the four dimensional nature of the simulations and 
important properties may be overlooked by the user. Visualising
gives the UKQCD group a new aspect on their data simply because it
provides a new way of viewing it.
<P>
Visualisation of QCD data is a relatively new field. This means that the
work carried out was a trial and error procedure. It was not known
if visualisation of the properties was possible, nor if
it would make any sense physically. The work done does provide a
basic structure and background to the visualisation
techniques available at EPCC. Hopefully this will lead to more
properties being visualised, and give the physicist insight 
into previously hidden properties.
<P>
The first part of the project that this manual accompanies of 
involves combining the data to 
produce particles called mesons 
(this is covered in the first part of the report for this project). 
The data which result describe the 
motion of a particle that originated at a point in space (the centre
of the data set). It is almost impossible to see what 
is happening to a three dimensional object by looking at two 
dimensional graph, so visualisation of the volume is important.
Included in this manual are the details of how to go about
creating and visualising mesons, starting with the original data
taken from the QCD simulations.
<P>
The second part of the project looks at visualising the function
used in the gauge 
fixing stage. This is a process that is carried out to make 
calculations easier
(for a more detailed explanation of this please refer to
report <A HREF=bibliography3_10.html#helenreportAshton>[1]</A> that accompanies this project).  
Without visualisation of this property it is very hard to tell 
if this stage has been implemented correctly.
<P>
It is therefore an important part of both validating the 
simulations, and for further research, to be able to visualise 
the various physical properties in a variety of ways.
