how we can contact you. If you have more than one first name, it would

As SSP projects always have a strong emphasis on computing, it is <em>vital</em>
that applicants should be able to demonstrate that they are competent
programmers. In particular, applicants should be familiar with the C
and/or Fortran77/90 progamming languages. You should highlight any
project work or course work which illustrates your ability to apply your
computing skills to practical problems.
We would also like to see some evidence that applicants can work as a member
of a team - either in a formal project related to the course of study, 
or perhaps in other areas of life

looking for students who have strong academic backgrounds, so if you have
received recognition for your abilities you should ensure that it is
explained here.</P>

<P>In addition to being academically capable, we are also looking for
applicants who have interests outside their work. We consider the social
aspects of the SSP to be an important part of the programme and we look
for applicants who would contribute towards it.</P>

to the SSP, what you hope to gain from the programme, and what you have
to offer. This is one of the most important parts of the form so you
