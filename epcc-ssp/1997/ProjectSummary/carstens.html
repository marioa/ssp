The aim of this project will be to develop a three dimensional model
for heat transport in sedimentary basins.
<P>
Hydrocarbons (oil and gas) are produced when sedimentary rocks rich in
organic material (source rocks) are heated to high temperatures (60 -
150 C) for long periods of time (millions to tens of millions of years).
This process of conversion from primary organic material to hydrocarbons
is known as maturation. The accurate assessment, and prediction, of the
maturity and maturation history of hydrocarbon source rocks is of key
importance to the oil industry when exploring for hydrocarbons in
sedimentary basins like the North Sea.
<P>
The maturation history of a source rock depends upon its heating
history. Temperature increases with depth of burial. In most basins the
vertical conduction of heat determines temperature variations and the
amount of heat supplied to source rocks. This "layered-earth" assumption
for heat transport is used in existing models of solid rock maturation.
This assumption is valid for most sedimentary basins.
<P>
A number of important oil discoveries have been made during the past
five years in the Faeroe-Shetland basin to the west of the British
Isles. This area is now the main area of active hydrocarbon exploration
in UK waters. The one-dimensional, layered-earth approximations for heat
flor is probably inadequate for this basin and may lead to significant
errors in determining source rock maturity and the timing of hydrocarbon
generation. The reason for this difficulty is a major period of volcanic
and igneous activity whcih affected the Faeroe-Shetland basin during the
early Tertiary (60-55 million years ago). This igneous activity would
have had a major impact on the temperature structure and transport of
heat in the sedimentary sucession of the Faeroe-Shetland basin, which
includes important source rock horizons. As igneous bodies were emplaced
lateral heat conduction is likely to have been extremely important and
may have outweighed vertical heat transport locally within the
sedimentary succession for several million years, thereby invalidating
the 1D vertical model for heat flow.
<P>
The project proposed here would concentrate on extending the existing
1-dimensional (vertical) models of heat transport to 3 dimensions, so
that the effects of these irregularly shaped additional heat soruces
could be determined. This project would be a simle first step to test
the importance of 3D heat flow for maturity modelling. If successful it
may lead to further research collaboration. Ultimatly, the development
of a geologically rigorous 3D heat flow model may be of great importance
for source rock maturity modelling and hydrocarbon exploration in the
Faeroe-Shetland basin and other sedimentary basins which have been
subjected to intense igneous activity.
<P>
The principle objective for the student will be to develop a three
dimensional model for heat transport. The student could start with a 3
dimensional rock volume with uniform thermal properties into which a
three dimensional heat source (representing a volcanic plug, dyke or
sill) is intruded. Once this primary model has been developed the
student could investigate the effects of making the model more
geologically reasonable, for instance by including sedimentary layers,
varying the thermal properties of the rocks and altering the timing and
amount of heat introduced. The student will also develop visualisation
tools to illustrate the effects of 3D heat flow on the rock volume.
These tools should be able to illustrate the temperature and heat flow
structure of the rock volume at different times and also illustrate the
thermal history of individual points, profiles and slices of the rock
volumes. 
<P>
The early Tertiary igneous activity in the Faeroe-Shetland basin took
place relatively quickly (within a few million years). It also happened
at a time when the main hydrocarbon source rock (the Kimmeridge Clay)
had been buried to depths just sufficent for the initiation of
hydrocarbon generation. The rapidity of this igneous activity, and the
irregular distribution of the new heat sources, may also invalidate an
additional assumption of existing maturity models, namely that heat
transport can be modelled as a steady-state process. If time is
available this key assumption could also be investigated.
