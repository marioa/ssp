The so-called magnetic anomaly field, the part left over when the
field generated by the geodynamo process operating in the deep
interior of the Earth has been removed, is due to the magnetization of
the Earth's near surface rocks. Satellite measurements of the anomaly
field have the advantage of being global, but the disadvantage that
they give a rather 'fuzzy' view, due to the distance of the satellite
from the sources. Two ways to treat this are either<P> (a)
downward-continue the field to the Earth's surface, where more detail
can be discerned <BR><I>or</I><BR> (b) model the distribution of magnetization that
causes the observed anomalies.<P> Both methods have a multitude of
solutions that fit the data; following standard practise in
geophysics, we find the smoothest such model. This gives the problems
a similar mathematical formulation, which involves solving a
data-by-data system of linear equations. An exact solution is
impractical for large satellite datasets, but only a small proportion
of the coefficients of the linear equation are numerically
significant. Thus, we can apply approximate solution methods such as
the biconjugate gradient algorithm. This is an iterative, and
therefore time consuming, method for large datasets on a single
processor; the main aim of the project, therefore, is to develop a
parallelized algorithm.<P>

Previous solutions to the downward-continuation problem have involved
either a singular value decomposition of the matrix relating model
coefficients to data, retaining only the eigenvectors associated with
the largest eigenvalues in the solution, or finding an 'almost
optimally smooth' solution, using an expansion of the model at only a
subset of the data points (and hence solving a smaller system of
equations). Both methods work satisfactorily on continental-sized
areas, but cannot provide global solutions. One method of modelling
the magnetization of crustal rocks is to divide the crust into blocks,
put a hypothetical dipole in the centre of each block and then solve
for the dipole moment that best fits the data; averaging the dipole
moment over the volume of the block then gives the magnetization.
Models with one dipole per satellite datum have been obtained using
the biconjugate gradient algorithm. The matrix structure for this
'equivalent dipole' and our optimally smooth model is similar, so we
are confident that the same approach will work for our modelling
method.<P>

The primary goal of the project is to produce a parallelized algorithm
to model either the downward-continued field or the distribution of
magnetization in the crust; the same algorithm will solve both
problems. Investigation of preconditioning the system to speed up the
convergence will be investigated. Further work may include
incorporating aeromagnetic data into the solution - these are
collected closer to the Earth's surface, over small patches. Matching
adjacent surveys flown at different times and with different
parameters has been a perennial problem in their interpretation; we
propose using the satellite data to achieve this. By using an
iterative, parallelized technique, it should be possible to preserve
the resolution of the aeromagnetic data. The two types of data have
vastly different amplitudes, due to being collected at different
heights above the sources; thus, a tricky part of this is getting the
relative weights of the two types of data correct, so that neither
dominates the solution. The matching process involves 'warping' the
longer wavelength content of the surveys, which in turn distorts the
source depths inferred from them that are a crucial part of
interpretation for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration. The project
could also investigate the differences in the source depths obtained
from the 'raw' aeromagnetic data, and those that have been integrated
with satellite data.<P>
