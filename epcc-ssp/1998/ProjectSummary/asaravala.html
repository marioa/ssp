<H2>Intersim Java: Extending the Network Simulator</H2>

The aim of this work is to extend the SSP project carried out by
Hernani Pedroso last year: "Intersim Java: A Modular Internetwork
Simulator".  The project will involve adding further protocols to the
existing simulator and writing a Graphical User Interface for it.<P>

Intersim is an ongoing research project within EPCC.  It involves a
collaboration between EPCC and the department of computer science to
build a set of simulation tools to support the complex process of
Internet protocol design.  The main project is currently under
consideration for funding but as a precursor we are investigating some
of the issues and attempting to produce proof of concept type
demonstrations with SSP work.<P>

The core of the work is a large scale microscopic internetwork
simulation package, Intersim-HP, based around the HASE simulatoin
environment and designed to take advantage of HPC.  We also plan to
build a sister application, Intersim-Java, written in Java and based
on the HASE-Java simulation environment.  The aim of Intersim-Java is
to provide a highly portable modelling environment with a user
friendly interface that will support the design and construction of
simulation models that can ultimately be ported to Intersim-HP.  Java
is an ideal language for this purpose, its clean, object-oriented
nature facilitates rapid prototyping and model reuse and discrete
event simulation modelling naturally fits into an object-oriented
framework.  A secondary aim for the package is its potential for use
as a teaching tool for network modelling.<P>

The project has two main aims:

<UL>
<LI>Extend the existing simulator by adding models of extra protocols
<LI>Add a GUI to the system to facilitate the construction simulation models.
</UL>

The second of these will form the bulk of the work.  Ideally the
interface will allow simulations to be constructed by dragging and
dropping packet sources, packet sinks and routers etc into a workspace
and then connecting them by clicking and dragging links.  Double
clicking on any of the objects will bring up a menu allowing the user
to set parameters for that object.  Once the network has been thus
specified, a "make" button will produce the code to run the model.
