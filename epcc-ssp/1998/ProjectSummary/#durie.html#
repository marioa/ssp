<H2>VisualGA: Visualisation of a Genetic Algorithm</H2>

The project will involve designing and implementing a visual simulation of
a genetic algorithm (GA). This will be used in the first instance as a
teaching aid for tutorials on genetic algorithms to facilitate
understanding of how and why GAs work. <P>

GAs are a novel computing area used, for example, in optimisation. They
have been applied in complex areas such as scheduling, bin packing, graph
colouring, set covering and travelling salesman problems. The method is
particularly relevant to high performance computing as GAs are highly
suited to parallelisation.  John Holland originated the idea of GAs in the
1970s with the "Simple GA"  where a `population' of solutions is randomly
generated, from which iteratively `parents' are selected and combined to
form `children', in such a way that successive generations will contain
better and better solutions to the problem under consideration. Since
then, many variations on this have been suggested and used.  The purpose
of the project will be to produce a visualisation of a GA at work. <P>

This will be particularly useful in explaining the key concepts of GAs and
to help to show how the method works. (Currently a primitive example version of
this exists - see Roger Hare for details.) <P> 

It is expected that the GA itself will be written in RPL2, a GA
programming language available at EPCC, rather than have a student spend a
lot of time writing genetic algorithm code from scratch. A Java server
will be used to run the RPL2 program, and to receive data from it. The
user interface will be through a Java applet, which will send queries to
the server and receive data originating from the RPL2 program. This data
will be used to update the simulation of the GA. <P>

Clearly this project requires a good understanding of GAs and the methods
used. The first stage of the project would therefore be for the student to
become familiar with the theory behind genetic algorithms, using GA
material available at EPCC. The next stage will be to decide on a problem
and a representation which can be shown graphically in an easily
understood manner. Based on this a simple GUI can also be designed.  The
GA can then be written : it is anticipated that initially this will follow
the form of Holland's "Simple GA". Finally the interface for the
simulation can be coded in Java and linked to the GA output.  This forms
the core of the project, however there is considerable scope for extending
the project, for instance, specific simulation of the workings of
crossover and selection; adding different types of genetic operators;
including parallelisation.
