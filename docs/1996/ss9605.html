<p>

Radiosity uses an energy balance approach to generating realistic
images of a scene. The scene is divided into a number of small
patches.  The fraction of energy (light) leaving each patch for all
other patches is computed. These are termed form factors. From the
starting conditions and the form factors a set of simultaneous
equations is derived. Solving this provides an energy level at each
patch which approximates the intensity that is observed. The result is
view-point independent.

<p>

A method know as progressive refinement may be used to converge on the
result without the need to store the entire matrix. This method
identifies the patch with the largest excess energy and distributes
that energy. This is repeated until the unshot energy at any patch
falls below a preset threshold.

<p>

Research effort concentrated on progressive refinement radiosity has
primarily focused on extending the realism by the introduction of
specular components. These increase the required rendering time and
often make the process view dependent. For example extended form
factors compute the contribution from one patch to another of the
energy which has been specularly reflected by an intermediate patch.

<p>

A simple progressive radiosity solver which uses the hemi-cube method
of form-factor determination will be provided. The primary objective
of the project will be to evaluate possible approaches to
parallelisation of this software, and to implement one or more of the
approaches.

<p>

It is expected the parallelisation work would use MPI.

<p>

The goal is not to produce complete realism, but to get acceptable
results as efficiently as possible.

<H3>Expertise Required</H3>

An interest in graphics. Reasonable C programming. Reasonable geometry
skills.

<H3>Resources Required</H3>

Workstation, access to colour display.

<H3>Resources Supplied</H3>

A number of papers on Radiosity.

A complete serial simple progressive radiosity solver using hemi-cube
base form factor determination.

<H3>Work Plan</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> Week 2: Familiarization with radiosity methods and serial code
  <LI> Week 3: Investigation of serial code to identify potential 
       parallelisations
  <LI> Week 4-7: Parallelisation of solver
  <LI> Week 8: Testing, including construction of large datasets
  <LI> Week 9: Generation of walk-through visualisations
  <LI> Week 10: Project write-up
</UL>

The work plan shown is for an average SSP student. A below average
student can extend the time spent on coding at the expense of the more
complex visualisations. A strong student who completes the listed work
could either extend the radiosity solver for example, to support a
more complex illumination model, or add a (serial) ray-tracing
rendering stage using POV.
