<H1>
Applications of Parallel Processing in Management Science and Operational Research
</H1>

<p>

In October 1996 a new MSc in Operational Research (OR) and Management
Science (MS) will be run within the departments of Business Studies
and Mathematics & Statistics.  An integral part of this course will be
the application of high performance computing to practical problems in
OR/MS.  One aspect of this will involve the construction of a set of
sample parallel programs for a few practical problems, so that
students can explore how the success of parallel implementations is
affected by the problem characteristics (eg sparsity, size) and the
solution approach (eg direct, iterative or decomposition methods).

<p>

In the past a number of Computer Science and Management Science
students have considered the implementation of OR/MS algorithms in
their honours year projects.  There are also several staff members in
the host departments with expertise in the application of parallel
processing to OR/MS problems.  Whilst this provides a base from which
to start, it does not yield a comprehensive view of the types of
problems that parallel processing might be applied to in OR/MS.
<p>

The aims of this project are to:

<UL>
  <LI> explore the range of possible solution approaches within the
       areas of OR and MS that could benefit from parallel processing;

  <LI> identify one or two practical problems that can be solved
       by each solution approach considered in 1;

  <LI> implement some of the solution approaches or problems on a network
       of workstations using FORTRAN and MPI with the aim of
       demonstrating as many different aspects of parallel processing
       as possible (eg task farm, domain decomposition, load balance);

  <LI> identify any factors that are common to the different
       implementations.
</UL>

<H3>Proposed Workplan</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> Week 1: Training course

  <LI> Week 2-3: Steps 1 and 2. Would involve liaising with members of
       the host departments and reviewing recent literature.

  <LI> Week 4-5: Implementation of a serial version of a single
       solution approach/problem combination.

  <LI> Week 6-9: Production of a parallel version and benchmarking
  <LI> Week 10: Report
</UL>

<H3>Problem Statement</H3>

A typical OR/MS problem is the Inventory Control.  This type of
problem is faced by a number of industries involved with manufacturing
and production.  The aim is to balance the cost of manufacturing,
storage against the failure to satisfy customer requirements.  It is
assumed in this project that more than one type of item is stored.
For this reason the dimensionality can be extremely large.  Frequently
the optimal solution is found by complete enumeration using discrete
optimisation.  This is therefore a very large problem which would be
ideally suited for parallel programming.

<p>

The formulation of the problem we feel most appropriate is via dynamic
programming, though, of course, it would be possible for the student
to explore alternative approaches.  Guidance could be given over a
range of alternative methodologies to tackle the problem.

<p>

A possible formulation as a simple recurrence relationship would be as
follows for the inventory control problem:

<p>

(Hard maths omitted - see paper copy!)

<p>

In a parallel implementation one could consider partitioning the
state space at period n-1 (the range of i), the action space at
period n-1 (the range of k) and/or the state space at stage n
(the range of j).

<p>

The data required by the problem would be the parameters of the
probability distribution and the cost data which are all assumed to be
stationary.  (Greater complexity would evolve if this assumption was not
taken.)

<p>

The level of complexity could be varied as required by considering 
multiple items and multiple depots.  We have real data for a large
scale inventory problem that could be made available to the student. 

<p>

Depending on the success of this, one or two more combinations can 
then be addressed.  As this problem shares certain characteristics 
with some problems in reservoir management and portfolio analysis, 
these areas might be suitable at this stage.

<p>

The outcome of the project would be Fortrn code which the MSc students
would be able to explore on UNIX workstations in Mathematics and
Statistics with Fortran and MPI. 

<H3>Experise Required</H3>

Fortran programming

<H3>Resources Required</H3>

Workstation network, FORTRAN90(or 77) and MPI.

<H3>Resources Supplied</H3>

<UL>
  <LI> Serial version of the code?
  <LI> Input data; this would depend on the specific size of problem
       addressed.  Items would require costs of manaufacture, storage and
       costs of lost trade.  There would also be parameters of distributions
       for demand for each item.
