<H1>
A Parallel Connectionist Viewpoint Quasi-Invariant Iconic Object Recognition System
</H1>

<p>

In a previous MSc project, Grove [1995] developed an iconic object
recognition system.  A key aspect of the foveation subsystem was the
extraction of image features from a foveated representation (ie.  where
image pixels represent smaller portions of the image the closer to the
centre of the image).  The other key aspect of the foveation subsystem
was the transformation from a cartesian to a radial representation,
which has advantages in matching (in providing a mechanism for scale and
rotation invariance). 

<p>

Grove's system then extracted a set of features based on Marr's primal
sketch: bars, edges, corners and blobs.  These were extract from 3*3
neighbourhoods of the iconic image, using a hard-coded pattern match. 
These features were matched to a set of stored model features, with a
serious of permutations to allow scale and rotation invariance. 

<p>

In testing Grove's program, it was found that it took about 30 seconds
to process each foveation on the fastest department machine at that time
(twain).  This was adequate for small scale testing, but means that
there is not much hope of real applications until a factor of 100
increase in speed per foveation point is achieved.  Much of the time
required is in the actual foveation process. 

<p>

This project will investigate a parallel re-implementation of the
existing project, in either a SIMD or a MIMD mode. 

<p>

A SIMD mode is suggested as each pixel in the foveal image can be
computed effectively in parallel, although requires input image regions
of varying size.  However, once that is done, feature extraction is done
independently on each pixel, as is most of the matching.  Thus, a lot of
processing over the 25*64 foveal image can be done in about 1000-way
parallel. 

<p>

On the other hand, MIMD processing should also be possible as each
feature plane can be extracted independently, and each
model/scale/orientation setting can be matched independently.  Each of
these processes could be assigned to an independent processor. 

<p>

While there is plenty of opportunity for distributing processing, doing
so without an excessive communication overheads will probably be the key
problem of either approach to the project. 

<p>

The main steps to the project are:

<ul>
  <li> Understanding the existing program.
  <li> Partitioning the program into a parallel structure on a workstation
       cluster using MPI (message passing interface). 
  <li> Debugging and analysing the program in the simpler context. 
  <li> Porting the programme to a larger machine, such and the
       Connection Machine CM-200 (SIMD) or the Cray T3D (MIMD). 
  <li> Running the program on a set of test images to assess parallel
       performance
</ul>
