Chris is originally from New York City. He is now in his 3rd year of
college at Harvard in Boston, concentrating in physics.

<p>

He spent his 1st year in college at Amherst College where he majored
in both physics and music, but then grew tired of music theory, not to
mention Amherst itself, so transferred.

<p>

He plays the piano, cello and recorder; at Harvard he plays cello in
every ensemble he possibly can, sometimes at the expense of his grades
(incidentally, he will not be able to bring his cello to Edinburgh so
if anyone knows where and how he might be able to borrow or rent one
while here, he'd be eternally grateful).

<p>

His main scientific interests are theoretical particle physics and
cosmology.  He hates signing email with his actual name.  It just
seems dull. He likes to climb trees.

That should be enough for now. Anyone who is terribly curious for more
can peruse his woefully incomplete <A
