Computer simulation of thermotropic liquid crystals
</H1>

<p>

The simulation of thermotropic liquid crystals is probably one of the
<b>hottest</b> topics amongst computer modellers of condensed matters.
This interest is largely motivated by the widening of areas in which
liquid crystals offer revolutionary alternatives to conventional
materials, the most famous example being that of the new generation LC
displays.

<p>

But what exactly is a liquid crystal? A liquid crystalline phase is a
phase <i>...in which long-range orientational order persists but
molecular centres of mass are (to some extent) disordered and
translationally mobile</i> [Allen and Tildesley 1987]. By opposition
to lyotropic LC (those found in detergents), thermotropic LC can be
formed solely by a variation in thermal energy and do not require any
interaction with a solvent. The simplest LC phase is known as the <i>
nematic phase</i> in which the molecules centre of mass are
translationally disordered but their axis are distributed along a
preferred direction called <i>the director</i>.

<p>

The first attempts to simulate the formation of such systems were
undertaken in the early 70's. The molecules were then represented as
hard spherocylinders or hard ellipsoids of revolution. Although some
evidence of the formation of a metastable orientationally ordered
liquid phase were obtained, those simulations suffered from serious
limitations.

<p>

Since then, the models were continuously refined to overcome
those limitations. The most noticeable improvement is the use
of soft orientation-dependent potentials such as the Gay-Bern
potential described by its characteristic shape parameter:

<p>

<i>(Hard to reproduce maths omitted!)</i>

<p>

Indeed, he use of such potentials allows to gain a better
understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of nematic
LC phases by introducing anisotropic repulsive and attractive
dispersion forces. An extensive series of simulations [Frenkel and
Mulder 1985] allowed to obtain a complete phase diagram for hard
ellipsoids of different length-to-width ratio. Current simulations
produce results much closer to experimental data.

The project consists in carrying out simple isothermal-isobaric
<i>NPT</i> Monte Carlo simulations of a system of 512 hard ellipsoids
of length-to-width ratio <i>a/b = 5</i> interacting by a Gay-Berne
potential. Observables such as the pair distribution function,
<i>g(r)</i>, the translational <i>rho(k)</i> and orientational order
parameters <i>P_2</i> can be monitored throughout the simulation to
identify the occurrence of a phase transition.

The project will be organised as two different stages:

<ul>
  <li> The first 3 weeks will be spent building the simulation code
       (partly from existing subroutines) and getting a basic understanding
       of the simulation techniques.
  <li> The remaining time will be used to carry out a series of
       simulations, process the data and visualise the different phases
       using AVS.
</ul>

The benefits of this project are obvious and multiple: firstly, the
student will receive a good introduction to state-of-the-art computer
modelling techniques. Furthermore, he will have the opportunity to
develop his programming skills with a particular emphasis on
optimisation techniques. This project gives a very good overview of
the type of work expected during a PhD and as such can prove to be an
invaluable experience for would-be PhD students.
