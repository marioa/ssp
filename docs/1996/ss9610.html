<p>

One of the major areas of difficulty in using MPI is in defining MPI
derived datatypes that match application data structures.  Since MPI
is a library it has no knowledge of the layout of program data
determined by the compiler.  Thus, layout information has to be
acquired explicitly and fed into the MPI datatype constructors.  This
can be laborious and error-prone.  These problems can be alleviated by
development of an MPI datatypes toolset.  Two ways in which assistance
can be provided are:

<ul>
  <li> compiler-level creation of MPI derived datatypes matching
       complex language types.
  <li> library support for creation of MPI derived datatypes matching
       common data sub-structures.
</ul>

Even though reasonably clear examples are given in the MPI standard
and elsewhere, defining datatypes to match C structures is not
elegant.  The formulaic nature of this procedure suggests development
of a pre-processing tool to generate functions/macros that create MPI
datatypes for marked structure definitions, perhaps similar to the
automatic generation of XDR (eXternal Data Repn) encoding/decoding
code via the <i>rpcgen</i> tool.  An example of a marked C structure is
given below.  This technique can, in principle, also be applied to
Fortran 77 <i>COMMON</i> blocks, and Fortran 90 derived datatypes. This
will require development of a parser that locates the marked sections
and parses the datatype definition.  To create a matching MPI derived
datatype, it is necessary to obtain the name of the type, and the name
and C type of each of its fields.  A sensible initial limitation would
be to disallow recursive types.

<pre>
#pragma MPIDT_STRUCT begin
  struct MsgObj 
{    unsigned char dest;
    char data[MSG_LEN];
    int crc;
  };
  #pragma MPIDT_STRUCT end

  int MPIDT_create_struct_MsgObj(MPI_Datatype *newtype);
</pre>

It  is  possible to provide  a portable  library  of calls that create
datatypes  for regular  structures, such as   the representation of  a
column in an array that can be composed  as though a  basic type.  (It
is relatively easy  to define an MPI   derived datatype with  a stride
covering the correct   distance in  an  array,  but to   compose  this
datatype  the  <i>extent</i> must  be   adjusted.  This adjustment  is
possible  but  requires a  detailed   understanding  of  MPI  datatype
construction.)    The library should  use  only  standard MPI datatype
constructors and so will be portable to any  MPI implementation on any
platform.

<p>

Direction in the library development may benefit  from a survey of use
of  MPI datatypes  in various  application areas.   As an example, the
prototype of  a     datatype constructor analogous   to    the Process
Topologies sub-space partition, for data arrays, is given below.

<pre>
MPIDT_ARRAY_SUB(eltype, ndims, dims, remain, newtype)

IN      eltype     basic datatype of element (handle) 
        IN      ndims      number of array dimensions (integer)
        IN      dims       integer array of size ndims specifying
                           the array size in each dimension 
        IN      remain     logical array of size ndims specifying
                           the dimensions covered by newtype
        OUT     newtype    new datatype (handle) 
</pre>

The suggested schedule for this project is as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Week 1</b> Course: C programming, MPI, Code management, LaTeX
  <li> <b>Week 2</b>  Familiarisation with advanced MPI datatypes 
  <li> <b>Week 3-4</b> Development of simple C <i>struct</i> MPI datatype
       generation
  <li> <b>Week 5</b> Testing and feedback (use in SSP code?) 
  <li> <b>Week 6-7</b> Development of F77 <i>COMMON</i> block MPI datatype
       generation <b>or</b> Development of F90 derived type MPI datatype
       generation <b>or</b> Extension of C <i>struct</i> MPI datatype
       generation
  <li> <b>Week 8</b> Testing and feedback (use in SSP code?) 
  <li> <b>Week 9</b> (Development/testing of C/F77 extended datatype library)
  <li> <b>Week 10</b>  Documentation and Report
</ul>

<h3>Expertise Required</h3>

The emphasis of the project will be on development of the
compiler-level tools, requiring development of a parser.  This will
likely involve use of <i>lex</i> and <i>yacc</i> parser generation
tools, and so will require C programming skills.  Knowledge of
compiler techniques would be useful, suggesting a student with a
Computer Science background.

<p>
       
The extended datatype constructor library could be implemented in
either C or Fortran.  If this project were to involve a survey of
applications use of MPI datatypes, some knowledge of computational
science would be useful.  This part of the project could be made more
suitable for a student from Physical Sciences; it is possible that
there would be a shortfall in project effort in restricting this
project to the library development part.

<h3>Resources Required</h3>

The tools will be developed on workstations and can be tested on any
MPI platform (EPCC or X-lab workstations, Meikos, T3D). There is no
requirement for visualisation capability.  It is likely that the
compiler-level project will require UNIX tools <i>lex</i> (or <i>
flex</i>) and <i>yacc</i> (or <i> bison</i>), which are available on
all EPCC workstations at least.

<h3>Resources Supplied</h3>

The compiler-level tool may benefit from publically available grammars
for  C, Fortran 77,  Fortran 90  data structure  definition; there are
known sources for at   least   C and Fortran 77.     The
language syntax definitions will  be   required.  Particularly for   a
survey  of MPI datatypes  use, but useful  for testing of any parts of
the   project, access to a set   of existing MPI applications (perhaps
resulting from other SSP projects).
