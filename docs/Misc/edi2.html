<B>We saw the Loch Ness Monster</B> floating about in the infamous lake one afternoon.  Unfortunately, everyone's camera jammed at that exact moment and we weren't able to get a picture of it.  We did, though, get a picture of people pointing at the beast.  The people you can actually see in this picture, from left to right, are Mario, Ruth, and Tom.  If you look closely, you can see Adam in front of Tom.  You can also see John's green shirt, and the back of Dave's and Giampetro's heads.

<B>We were disappointed</B> at not getting a picture of the monster.  Luckily, Adam and I caught up to it outside of a Burger King in Inverness.  After much bribing, we came away with this pristine picture.  It may very well be the first clear photograph of the Loch Ness Monster.

<B>The Highlan' Coo</B> is another evasive animal, with a cunning wit and clever escape tactics.  Their plan is quite simple in reality: whenever danger approaches, <I>do absolutely nothing</I>.  Here we have a herd of coo doing just that.

<B>John soon realized</B> that the animals were not to be messed with.  Here, he stands amidst the sheep on Holy Island.  Although not technically in Scotland, Holy Island is the United Kingdom's version of Mont Saint Michel.  During high tide, the sea water surrounds the island and makes it impossible to leave by foot or car.

<B>The midges</B>, the worst of all living creatures in Scotland, attacked us in droves.  These tiny, blood-sucking insects somehow knew exactly where we were standing.  The only way to fight them off was to
cover up completely.
