<B>The many lochs</B> that lie all over Scotland were great places to take lunch breaks.  By the end of our second trip, we were quite adept at skipping stones across lake surfaces.  Although we would never win an old-fashioned Scottish caber-toss, we would always be able to skip stones if we suddenly needed to.

<B>It was not always easy</B> exploring the Scottish Highlands.  We often came across natural barriers which could only be traversed by simple rope bridges.  In the picture at right, I am bravely maneuvering across one of these bridges, well aware that if I fall, I will drop an <I>entire two meters</I> into the river below.  That's an incredible six feet!  Seventy-two whole inches!

<B>Quirang</B>, on the Isle of Skye, was one of our more difficult hiking experiences.  The volcanic rock formations were breath-taking.  So was the mud.  (I believe that's Tom's back that you can see in the foreground.)

<B>Life's good at the top</B>.  Tom, John, Dave, and Adam conned me into taking
the long way back from Quirang.  We slipped over wet grass, stepped in hidden streams, and fell in mud.  But it was worth it.

<B>Mario and the Sea</B>.  Mario had never been to the open ocean before.  Here,
 with the hills of Skye behind him, he touches salt water for one of the first times in his life.
