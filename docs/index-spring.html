<H2><CENTER>What is the SSP?</CENTER></H2>
</b></font>
The Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP) is a unique training scheme;
since its inception in 1987, more than 150 senior undergraduates have
been employed to work on 10-week projects looking at various aspects of
High Performance Computing. 
<P>
The students are given a one week formal training course and then work on
an assigned project with one, or sometimes two, supervisors. At the
end of the period each project is written up in a formal
report. 
<P>
Electronic versions of past SSP reports are available for
<A
href="1999/projects99.html">1999</A>,
<A
href="1998/projects98.html">1998</A>,
<A
href="1997/projects97.html">1997</A>,

<A

and <A
href="1994/projects94.html">1994</A>.
There is also some information on the <A
href="students93.html">1993</A> projects.

During their stay the students are supported by grants from EPCC;
competition for places is fierce with some 100 applicants for the
available spaces.
<P>
At SuperComputing 1994 a past co-ordinator of the programme presented a
paper describing in detail the operation of the programme. A copy of the
paper is available <A
href="SC_paper.ps.Z">here</A>.
