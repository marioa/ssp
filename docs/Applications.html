<P>

The Summer Scholarship Programme is a unique training scheme; since its
inception in 1987 more than 150 senior undergraduates have been employed
to work on 10-week projects in the application of high performance
computing to a wide variety of problems. In 1999 we took 11 students
from France, Germany, Greece, the Republic of Ireland and the 
UK, working on projects ranging from modelling the impact of Genetically Modified crops on the flora associated with agriculture to developing a parallel benchmarking suite for Java Grande applications.
<P>
Students are given a one week formal
training course and then work on an assigned project under supervision
from a member of EPCC staff. At the end of the period each project is
written up in a formal report.  During their stay the students are
supported by grants from EPCC; competition for places is stiff with some
150 applicants for the available places.  EPCC will be offering 12
places
in the year 2000. The Programme will begin in Edinburgh on Monday 3rd July
2000,
and will run for 10 weeks. The scholarships are worth  150 pounds
sterling per week. Where students are travelling from outside the UK we can
arrange accommodation at a cost of around 60 pounds per week.  Students have to
pay their own costs travelling to and from Edinburgh.

<H3>Requirements</H3>

The Programme is open to talented senior undergraduates in any
discipline with an emphasis on computer programming.  Knowledge of C
and/or Fortran is essential, but no experience of parallel computing is
necessary. High academic marks are an advantage, but student selection
is based primarily on programming ability and enthusiasm.
<P>
All teaching and supervision is English based.  All
applicants should be able to demonstrate a high level of fluency in
English.
