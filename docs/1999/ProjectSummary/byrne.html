The Foundations of Physics half-course, Physics 1Ah, was ported to use
a web-based delivery mechanism this year. Behind the scenes a
question-authoring CGI script was developed for Physics by EPCC which
enabled the course team to author questions via the web. These could
then be exported to WebCT, a semi-commercial delivery package, and
also to latex format which could be used to provide paper-based
sources of the material.  In its development the authoring script
became what can best be described as a monolithic working
prototype. It consists of over 4000 lines of Perl code with a lot of
hacks to change behaviour, add functionality and correct or work
around bugs.<P>

WebCT comes with its own question-authoring software but this was not
used because:
<UL>
<LI> a conscious choice was made to use latex as the input format. This  
required pre-processing that had to be done outside of WebCT.</LI>

<LI> a conscious attempt was made to decouple the authoring mechanism from
the delivery mechanism. However at the moment the authoring script is
coupled more tightly to WebCT than is desirable.</LI></UL>

The aims of this SSP project are:
<UL>
<LI> to streamline and modularise the existing code. This should help the
maintenance and extension of these scripts in the future. It should also
make things a little bit faster.</LI>

<LI> to decouple somewhat the export mechanism to WebCT to allow
another export module to be incorporated to export to another delivery
mechanism.  This would return the authoring script to the
originally-envisaged goals.</LI>

<LI> to examine existing practice and try to streamline and/or improve
it - make the reliance of external packages, e.g. latex2html and unix
commands, more robust.  Examine new technologies, e.g. XML, to see
whether these can be incorporated.</LI>

<LI> to add new functionality - physics may wish to incorporate new
functionality to the package after having used it for a year.</LI>

<LI> provision of documentation - this would be required as well as
the project report. At the moment there is not a great deal of
documentation other than in the source available.</LI>

<LI> examine the existing security model to see whether it can be
improved.</LI></UL>

<HR> The final report for this project is available <A
HREF="../../1999/Reports/ss9904.pdf">here</A>.
