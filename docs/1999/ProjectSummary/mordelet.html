<H4>Summary</H4>

Efficient design of tomorrow's communications networks represents a
crucial challenge for telecommunications companies world-wide. With
the continued explosive growth of the Internet it is clear that
existing simulation technology and hardware testbed systems cannot
keep pace. One area of considerable current interest is the
development of the necessary protocol standards required to transmit
voice over IP (VoIP). There are several proposed solutions to this
problem, and this project aims to construct simulation models of two
or more of these solutions and to write a paper comparing and
contrasting the differences. The project will use the <I>ns</I>
simulator developed by UC Berkeley.<P>

<H4>Internet simulation</H4>

Telecommunications is an industry in turmoil which will undergo
fundamental changes in the years ahead. Multi-media and Internet based
applications are driving an exponential increase in demand for
bandwidth.  In 1997 WorldCom reported a 1000% growth in Internet
traffic over its network and recent US Commercial Department data
confirmed that data traffic is doubling every 100 days. In contrast,
voice data is growing by only 10% a year. If these patterns continue,
Internet volumes will match those of voice in the year 2000 and by
2005 voice will represent only 1% of global traffic. Coupled with
this, Internet Commerce is gradually becoming established.  Companies
like Dell computers have seen sales via its Website increase from $1m
per day to $4m per day in less than 12 months. These trends have led
WorldCom executives to start referring to voice as a niche
market. Regardless of how you project these figures forward it seems
clear that IP traffic will be a huge part of the information exchange
of the future.<P>

This growth, and change in the nature of traffic represents a huge
opportunity and headache for telecoms operators because although the
volumes may be growing at 1000% p.a. revenues are not. The only way
to remain competitive in this rapidly changing market place will be
to most effectively harness the power of emerging network
technologies. <P>

<H4>Internet Telephony</H4>
Taken from <I>http://207.127.135.8/ni/public/1999/may/index.html</I><P>

Every ten years or so, the most basic of telecommunications services,
the telephone, undergoes a dramatic change. In the 1950s, the
introduction of transatlantic coax cables allowed direct-dial
international calls; in the 1960s, digital transmission and switching
drastically improved the audio quality; in the 1970s, programmable
switches enabled touch-tone dialing and local services such as call
waiting; and in the 1980s, the widespread implementation of
out-of-band common-channel signaling systems like Signaling System 7
(SS7) made services such as 800- numbers possible. These changes
define a trajectory from analog transmission and signaling to digital,
circuit-switched transmission and packet-based signaling.  In the
1990s, Internet telephony marks the latest step along this slow path
to an all-packet infrastructure.<P>

Its history actually began 20 years earlier. The first papers on how
to transmit voice were published in the early 1970s, and the first
Internet packet audio experiments took place in August 1974, when
real-time packet voice was demonstrated between the University of
Southern California's Information Sciences Institute and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory. The first
Request for Comments for packet voice, RFC 741, was published in 1977.
Internet telephony developed relatively slowly until 1991 and 1992,
when packet-audio experiments were performed on DARTnet and the first
IETF meetings were multicast across the Mbone. I made my first
Internet phone call to Switzerland around 1992, but such
communications were limited to research labs and targeted primarily at
multiparty teleconferences, rather than person-to-person phone
calls. Even if you had Internet connectivity of sufficient bandwidth,
there was no way to reach a particular person short of exchanging each
other's email addresses by email or regular telephone.<P>

In 1995, Vocaltec introduced one of the first PC-based Internet
telephony applications. Gateways to the public switched telephone
system (PSTN) followed shortly thereafter, although most were
initially limited to a few analog ports. There was also a shift away
from using end systems like PCs, which connect directly to the
Internet, and toward using regular telephones on both ends instead.<P>
