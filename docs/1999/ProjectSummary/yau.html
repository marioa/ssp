The issue of the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops into UK
agriculture is of current, major public concern.  Among the first crops
that are likely to be granted commercial licenses will be varieties of
oilseed rape that carry genes which make them resistant to the general
herbicide glyphosate.  While fears over the possible food safety issue
relating to GM crops are difficult to study, the environmental impact of
their introduction is probably easier to examine and to model.<P>

It is very easy to predict in a general way that herbicide-resistant GM
crops will induce changes in the flora associated with crop production. 
The herbicides used with GM oilseed rape impose a severe control over
weed growth, but are more effective against some species than others. 
Basic ecological theory suggests that if  the repeated use of such
herbicides tends to kill off some species quicker than others, those
that are better able to survive the chemical will be at a selective
advantage and may come to dominate the weed flora.  Additional long-term
complexities may arise through the evolution of weeds that are resistant
to the herbicide, and the "escape" of the trans-gene from the crop to
weed relatives by interbreeding.  In both these cases again, weeds with
resistance to the herbicide will be at a selective advantage and may
dominate the weed flora.  Considering the landscape at a regional or
national level, the GM crop may become a weed itself and modelling this
process for the purposes of prediction would be of considerable
political and public interest.<P>

SAC is currently undertaking a series of research projects commissioned
by the Scottish Office to examine and model the impact of GM oilseed
rape on the weed flora at sites where GM oilseed rape is being grown on
a trial basis.  Since any trials conducted will be relatively short
term, and since the public require predictions of the likely long-term
impact of GM crops on the environment, a modelling approach appears to
be the only option for providing the "answers" that are required now. 
While SAC's research did not originally include plans to use a parallel
computing environment for the modelling work, the potential complexity
of the system being examined may mean that translating the work to the
parallel computing environment would be beneficial.<P>
