<p>
One of the most innovative and successful projects from SSP 2000 was
<em>JiniGrid</em> (SS-2000-02). This resulted in a prototype Grid
infrastructure based on Jini, an existing communications protocol
originally designed for mobile devices. Although very general in design,
the implementation focussed on Task Farm applications motivated by
earlier work in <em>High Performance Java for the Hitachi SR2201</em>
(SS-1998-10). Ben Clifford, the student who worked on JiniGrid, proposed
a number of possible pieces of further work. One of the most interesting
ideas was the extension of JiniGrid to accommodate more general parallel
jobs.
</p>

<p>

How difficult would it be to convert this into a general purpose
compute server, rather than just a task farm? It would be difficult to  
make a completely generic remote parallel server, but specific models
could fairly easily be produced. For example, a message passing compute 
service could be defined, with an abstract message passing library which
could use threads or MPI or whatever was available on the server. In the
end, one might end up with an array of different service types: task   
farms, message passing, shared memory multi-threaded, single threaded,
with servers implementing as many of these models as they could.
</p>

<p>

The message-passing interface for Java has gradually converged to MPJ
(an MPI-inspired API), so this seems like the most natural choice. In
addition, EPCC is currently developing a number of MPJ benchmarks for
the Java Grande Forum, so there will be existing MPJ parallel
applications to use during verification. Although running MPJ jobs on
the JiniGrid may not be too difficult, determining what resources are
available and choosing which machine to use is a much bigger issue. The
mechanism is already in place with the concept of meta-servers, but the
existing implementations are extremely basic and exhibit almost no
intelligence (there was simply no time available during the initial
project). Ben suggests:
</p>

<p>

There could also be "adaptor" services (like meta-servers) that
would re-expose a message passing server as a task farm server. How do
we pick which is the best server to use? A number of metrics could be
developed based on expected speed, expected time until job completes,
etc, perhaps based partly on the Java Grande benchmarks.}
</p>

<p>

The problem of characterising machine performance is difficult. However,
the obvious choice for Java, as suggested above, is to use EPCC's JGF
Benchmark rating as a universal standard.
</p>

<p>

As well as extending the JiniGrid system, an early deliverable will be a
packaged-up version of the original software for external distribution.
This exercise is naturally done in tandem with familiarisation with the
existing code and therefore does not represent a significant overhead.
</p>

<p>

It will be important throughout the project to identify and exploit any
overlaps with the ongoing MHD portal work. For example, perhaps a
JiniGrid could be a back-end service for the portal? Maybe the JiniGrid
interface can borrow technology from the portal GUI, or there may be
opportunities to share common support services such as resource
discovery mechanisms.
