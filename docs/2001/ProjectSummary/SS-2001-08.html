<p>
The simulation of the electronic structure of materials from first
principles is a well-established part of high performance computational
science. The last few years have seen rapid advances in affordable
desktop computing power, and it is now common for pump-priming or
high-throughput simulations to be performed on these desktops.
As the variety of available platforms increases, so does the time spent
training people to deal with, and dealing with, the particular details of
the implementation of the code on different platforms. In many cases,
the end-user could be protected from issues concerning file types,
job submission rules and file transfers. These "under the bonnet" issues
are less important for the user whose primary focus is doing the simulations.
The advent of Internet / Grid computing is one possible solution to this
problem, and this proposal is for the development of a portable set of
tools for the management and deployment of electronic structure calculations.
In the context of EPCC's project to design a "Universal Portal Toolkit", this
will equate to the development of an electronic structure UI, capable
of distributing simulations across a variety of machines (SMP, Beowulf, PC
MPP etc) using different codes.

<H2>Aims & Objectives</H2>
</B></font>

<ol>

<li>
To design and implement tools for submission and reporting of
first-principles (fp) calculations, as aprt of EPCC's e-Portal toolkit.

<li>
To become familiar with the issues involved with and mechanics of
running these calculations on lomond.

<li>
3xtensions of the basic tools to cover

<ul>

<li>
        sanity checking

<li>
        different calculation types (eg static and MD)

<li>
        status reporting

<li>
        basic visualisation

<li>
        adaptation to other codes (eg CASTEP)

</ul>
</ul>

<font face='Futura,Arial,Helvetica' color='#a51042'><B>
<H2>Work Plan</H2>
</B></font>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Focus on a set of generic "job types" eg classical MD, ab initio MD,
electronic structure of molecules, to span a range of widely-used codes.

<li>
As well as the issues of handling large datasets (typically 100+MB, can
be as large as GB's) and file types, submission, clean-up etc there are
partciular issues that could be tackled:

<li>
Visualisation tools : typically, the output files from a job may be used as
the input files to a subsequent job (eg a coordinate file in an MD simulation).
Tools to allow the user to visualise the data before re-submission would
be extremely useful (eg AVS network)

<li>
This also implies the need for a filestore as part of the toolkit, to
minimise large down- and up-loads of data.
</ul>
</p>

<p>

Possible timeline:
</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Weeks 1-2 Courses (MPI / OpenMP/ Java? / Visualisation)

<li>Weeks 3-4     Familiarisation with calculations using VASP and
                EPCC e-Portal

<!-- Weeks 3-5
   First-principles calculations on different architectures : experience in
running test calculations on SMP, Beowulf, PC machines. Scaling and efficiency.
Extraction of information that the end-user wants on job completion.<li>Weeks 6-9
   Tool development within EPCC -->

<li>Weeks 5-6  Design and implement basic interface that can identify
                an input file bundle, override certain parameters of these
                files (to allow continuation job / different type of calc)
                and specify output location.

<li>Weeks 7-9     Extension of basic interface to cover some of ideas in (3)
                above.

<li>Week 10 - report

</ul>

<H2>Computing Skills Required</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

<ul>
<li>Programming experience in C / (++) / Java / (Fortran)?
<li>xperience / exposure to first principles simulation calculations an
advantage, though certainly not a prerequisite.
