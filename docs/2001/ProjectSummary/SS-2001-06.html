<p>
Requirements: An SSP student that already has some experience of CGI 
            programming ideally using perl. Knowledge of
            databases especially MySQL would be a definite
            advantage.
</p>

<p>

The TRACS Programme has been running in EPCC now since 1993. See:

</p>

<a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/tracs/'>http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/tracs/</a>

<p>

This allows EC researchers to come to EPCC for a period of four to
thirteen weeks to develop, optimise, parallelise their code and use
EPCC resources to further their own research. As part of this Programme
the visitor is given access to terminals which are owned by EPCC and
are distributed to host departments, mainly located in Edinburgh, for
the duration of the visit. In the past keeping track of these
resources has been problematical. As a potential solution an on-line
database accessible through the web is being developed that aims to aid
in tracking this hardware and the visitor. The database, currently
based around MySQL though the interface should be general enough to
use any other database engine, can also be expanded to contain
information that would be useful to those that administer the TRACS
Programme.

</p>

<p>

At present there is a design for the database and an implementation to
access and display most of the records. This is done using PerlDBI to
connect to the database - again this makes the implementation
independent of the database engine used to store the data. We would
like to complete the existing implementation and then, if time allows,
to extend the database and the access CGI scripts to extend the
functionality and data that can be stored in the database.

<p>

There is certainly a lot of work here that potentially may be of 
interest. The exact nature will depend on what has been done by
the time of the SSP. The result will most definitely be of use
to EPCC and the student will benefit from the skills/knowledge
gained. If we get a super bright student then we could get him to
extend the capabilities of the system as presently envisaged.
</p>

<p>

A more detailed proposal will be made once the program design has
come to fruition. Nearer the SSP we will also  be able to field
a more detailed work plan depending on what has been done by
that stage.

<H2>Work Plan</H2>
</B></font>

<p>
This part is only very preliminary and will be extended nearer the time.
</p>

<p>

week 1: Courses.<br>
week 2: Overview of the CGI program design & database set up.<br>
        Familiarisation with the existing implementation.<br>
week 3: Write a perl script that will enter an XML file containing information
        about an applicant into the database.<br>
week 4: Complete the input/output routines to the database.<br>
week 5: Design and implement an administration layer for the database.<br>
week 6: Design and implement a way for the EPCC TRACS contacts to enter 
        information about their meetings with visitors.<br>
weeks 7-9: Implementation.<br>
week 10: Report & Poster Writing.
</p>

<H2>Computing Skills Required</H2>
</B></font>
<p>

The skills that will needed for this project are:

<ul>

       <li>Perl
       <li>PerlDBI
       <li>CGI Scripting
       <li>Knowledge of MySQL
       <li>SQL
       <li>RCS

</ul>

This will be gained during the project if it does not already exist.
The Workplan above is only intended to be an initial guide for what 
will be done during the project.

<p>
In terms of resources - access to a workstation and the EPCC cluster should
be sufficient.
