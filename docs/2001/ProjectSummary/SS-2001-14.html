<p>
John has suggested the project below. Bits and pieces still need to
be sorted out. We need access to the CORC API. He is trying to do
this at present. The button could probably be embedded as a netscape
plug-in though this will probably mean that it will be browser/OS
specific. If this is the case then the browser will probably be
netscape and the OS one of the MS variants - win98/NT. Issues still
remain to be resolved but (at present) it looks tentatively doable.
</p>

<p>

SELLIC has a member of staff who catalogues web resources using
an American web-based system called CORC (Cooperative Online Resource
Catalog).  The way it works is by providing a downloadable button on
her browser toolbar, which allows her to enter the CORC system web
site from any web resource which she happens to be in (CORC analyses
the web site into its metadata, which she then edits). This is useful,
but it does not give us all that we wish from the system. What we
would also like would be a downloadable browser button which we could
install in the browsers of academic staff. The idea would be that,
when in a web resource which they'd like us to add to the library
catalogue, they could click the button and send the metadata direct to
a cataloguer's workfile (on a library server).  This therefore serves
to provide a demand-driven supply of web resources to catalogue.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

The development will require access to the CORC API, in order to
permit data to be written back to the CORC server, which stores the
cataloguer's workfile. Since we have discussed this enhancement with
the CORC people in the US a few times, and they have admitted that it
would be a useful feature, but can't promise when they might develop
it, I expect they would cooperate with us in providing access to the
API
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

If we can get that far, there is another feature I'd like to see
added. When a user is requesting that a resource *which they have
developed* is added to the catalogue, they should be given the option
of having metadata for their site sent back to them once the
cataloguing has been done (in Dublin Core html). This should simply be
by means of an alert in the cataloguer's workfile.

<p>
Good knowledge of C++ (probably). Previous development of
 	       netscape plug-ins a definite plus. Familiarity with MS
	       OS'es might be good too.
