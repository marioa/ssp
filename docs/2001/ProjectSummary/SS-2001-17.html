The Grid is billed as the future of top-end computing, the facilitator
of a new computational science, eScience.  The Grid purports to offer
a seamless, ubiquitous computing environment in the same way that the
Web today offers a seamless information environment.  So much of the
current work on Grid computing concentrates on systems-level
difficulties, taking a bottom-up approach to building Grids.  All well
and good, but, one area of Grid computing that has attracted much less
attention is arguably the most important: the user perspective.
Building a globally-connected computing infrastructure is all very
well, but who will use it, and for what?  EPCC believes this use-case
approach to Grid computing has been neglected, and with this in mind
we are developing a Grid computing solution for a specific yet broad
class of users: computational scientists who want to do science rather
than computing.
<p>

EPCC are working with the UK Magneto-Hydrodynamics (MHD) consortium,
funded by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, to
develop the prototype for a software toolkit to build a single
"Universal Portal" for eScientists.  The Portal will offer a single
view of the range of available software packages for scientific
simulations, in particular for some of the MHD consortium's solar
physics codes.  The MHD scientists will be able to select a computing
service, including a "don't care where it runs" service, to run their
particular jobs using their favourite package, but in a transparent
way that frees them from the details of the computing and allows them
to concentrate on the science.  No matter whether their job runs on a
Compaq Alpha cluster, a Cray T3E or a home-grown Beowulf system, their
program interface will be the same, the details of job submission will
be hidden, data format issues will be dealt with behind the scenes and
the science will be brought to the fore.
<p>

A prototype ePortal system, built for the MHD consortium but designed
to be extesible, already exists. The system architecture is based upon a

three-tier generic client - portal - High Performance Computing (HPC)
server structure, whereby a central core of services running on the
ePortal
site connects an arbitrary number of remote Web clients to sets of HPC
servers. The system has been developed using Java and XML since these
two
technologies constitute the core of Web-based services today; Java
providing
the tools to develop secure, portable and platform-independent Web-based

applications and XML their means of communication via structured,
platform-independent data representation and exchange.
<p>

The system currently allows a user to login to the ePortal via a
front-end
Web browser, select a single MHD solar physics code and the Compaq Alpha

cluster situated in St Andrews on which to run the code and specify the
parameters for the job run. Once this information is submitted, the job
parameters are sent to the portal tier and forwarded on to the Compaq
Alpha
cluster where the code is run accordingly and results are sent back to
the
portal for forwarding to the user via email.
<p>

This project proposes to extend the ePortal prototype as it currently
stands
in two main ways:
<ol>
  <li> Extend the back-end Portal services to include the EPCC Sun
cluster
       (lomond) and Beowulf cluster (bobcat) in the list of HPC service
       providers;
  <li> Extend both front- and back-end services to include additional
       code services for the MHD consortium.
</ol>
