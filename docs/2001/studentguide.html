<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> A Student's Guide to the EPCC Summer Scholarship Programme</h2>
</B></font>

<p>

This document is intended to provide students working in <a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/'>EPCC</a> under
the Summer Scholarship Programme (<a href=''>SSP</a>) with information on how the Programme
will run. Hopefully it will save the sending of hundreds of e-mails
throughout the summer, and provide a convenient single reference
source for the summer. Please address any questions to
<code><A HREF="mailto:epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk">epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk</A>
</code>. 
</p>

<p>
More information about the Programme is also
available via the SSP web page <a href="">here</a>.
</p>


<p>

The list of this years projects and students is 
<a href="2001/projects.html">here</a>.
This one is <em>important</em> - it describes what <em>you</em> will be doing this
summer...
</p>

<p>

Notice that there are several links to web pages in the preceding two short paragraphs. 
We use the world-wide web <em>a lot</em> at EPCC - much local information is available
only via the web, and we will expect you to use that information. Links are provided
where necessary.

</p>

<A NAME="introduction"></a>

<font face='Futura,Arial,Helvetica' color='#a51042'><B>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Introduction and Background</H2>
</B></font>

<p>
Students have been working during the summer at EPCC and its
precursors for more than 10 years. In that time, what is now the Summer
Scholarship Programme grew from two students to a peak of 26.
These days, we aim to accommodate 12 students during the programme.


</p>

<p>

Through the Summer Scholarship Programme we offer scholarships to
students (mainly undergraduates) to work at EPCC for 10 weeks during
their summer vacation. This year, the scholarships are worth &#163;150
per week. Each student works on an individual project, under the
supervision of EPCC staff. Often these projects involve collaboration
between EPCC and other groups within the local Universities.

</p>

<p>

The programme offers benefits to the students, the collaborators, and
EPCC: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Benefits to the students.</strong> Students get the opportunity to use
high performance computers, to which they would be unlikely to have access in
  the course of their studies. They also get the experience of
  managing their time, performing a real piece of work, and presenting
  their work both verbally and on paper.

<li>
<strong>Benefits to collaborators.</strong> Collaborating groups within the
  University receive ten weeks' free labour on a project of interest
  to them in return for assistance with supervision. This allows them
  to evaluate the usefulness of our resources in their particular
  application area without investing large amounts of time and effort.

<li>
<strong>Benefits to EPCC.</strong> EPCC benefits in several ways. Firstly, we are
  creating a skill base by training students in how to exploit
  high performance computers. Making graduates with experience of parallel
  and high performance computing available to industry can only help to accelerate the
  uptake of parallel and high performance computing. Secondly, the SSP has been a very
  successful recruiting mechanism for the Centre, with several of our
  current staff coming through it. Finally, through collaborative
  projects, we can attract new users to our resources, increasing our
  user community, and perhaps catalysing the use of high performance and parallel computing
  in new applications areas.

</ul>

<p>
This year 12 students from China, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia, 
Spain (2), U.K. (4) and Ukraine, will be spending the summer at
EPCC. Some of these students are studying at institutions outside their home countries
- these are in Spain, U.K., Ukraine and U.S.A.

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Travel:</strong>
Students travelling from outside Edinburgh to join the programme will be expected to
pay their own travel costs to and from Edinburgh. It is essential that you let us know
what your travelling arrangements are (flight number, etc.), and when you expect to
arrive in Edinburgh. Further details will be asked for when we require these.

<li>
<strong>Salary:</strong>
This year, the scholarships are worth &#163;150
per week. This will be paid weekly by cheque. You will need a U.K. bank account if you
do not already have one - we will help you set this up after you arrive. We use the
University branch of the Bank of Scotland in the Student Centre, Potterow for this
purpose - this is the only bank where we are able to open short-term accounts like
this.

<li>
<strong>Accommodation:</strong>
Accommodation for students not already resident in Edinburgh will be provided in
University apartments, either on-site or close by. We have to charge for accommodation
and these charges will be deducted from the weekly stipend before payment. At the
moment, these charges are approximately &#163;57.75 per week.

<li>
<strong>Accounts:</strong> All students will have accounts set up on:

<ul>
<li>

<code>garnet</code> the EPCC `training' server. Access to other EPCC machines will be
via <code>garnet</code> whose file system is cross-mounted with other EPCC machines
(except the T3E) thus allowing many house-keeping tasks to be carried out here.

<li>

<code>holyrood</code>, the University's principal central computer - you
  will need to log onto this system to access your EPCC account(s) from
  the EUCS PC Lab (Room 3210).

<li>

Any other EPCC machines necessary for the project you are working on (these are
described in more detail later).

</ul>

Additionally, students may have accounts set up on:

<ul>

<li>
Sun SMP cluster (<a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/sun/'><code>lomond</code></a>) - many
 of the projects require using this machine

<li>
The Beowulf cluster (<a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/bobcat/'><code>bobcat</code></a>) - where relevant to the project

<li>
The Cray T3E (<a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/t3e/'><code>sn3710</code></a>) - benchmarking only

<li>
The Windows NT PC cluster - benchmarking only

</ul>

We would expect that most projects which involve parallel computers would use the Sun
SMP cluster. Some access will be available to the Beowulf cluster, the Cray T3E and
Windows NT cluster, but it is expected that this would be for benchmarking purposes
only.

<li>

<strong>Planning:</strong> Your supervisor will have an initial programme of
  work for you to undertake as soon as you begin work on the
  project. You will meet with your supervisor(s) during
  your first week here (e-mail is generally the best way of contacting
  them to arrange a time) to discuss your project and the work you will
  be doing.

<li>

<strong>Code:</strong> Some projects will require certain pieces of code to be
  available for you. These might be sequential source codes, or
  existing parallel implementations, for example. It is the
  responsibility of the EPCC supervisor of each project to ensure that
  these codes are available to you on the relevant machine(s).

<li>
<strong>Data:</strong> Similarly, some projects will require certain data sets to
  be available. It is again the responsibility of your EPCC supervisor
  to make any such data sets available to you.

<p>

You should ensure that you are adequately provided for in the case of a medical
emergency arising while you are in Edinburgh. For most European nationals, there
are reciprocal arrangements between the different countries medical services. 
The somewhat arcane rules are
listed <a href='http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/tracs/medical.html'>here</a>. This URL
also describes emergency dental and optical treatment facilities.

</p>

<p>

Anyone not
covered by these rules may wish to consider taking out private medical insurance for
the visit.

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Accommodation Notes</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

For those of you staying in the accommodation provided by us, the flat is fully
furnished and we provide bed-linen, but you must bring your own towels.  This year we
have rented a 10-person flat on the King's Buildings campus itself.

</p>
<p>

<em>Please can you let us know what time you arrive in Edinburgh so we
can make the necessary arrangements for collecting the keys.</em>

</p>
<p>

The address of the flat is <br><br>
64/3 West Mains Road,<br> 
Edinburgh,<br> 
EH9 3JE,  <br> 
United Kingdom.

</p>
<p>

There is a telephone in the flat where you can receive incoming calls, and with an
international phone card such as a Jubilee card you should also be
able to call out by first dialling a freephone number.

</p>

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> What to do when you arrive in Edinburgh</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

If you are arriving in Edinburgh by air, then you can either get to
this part of town by airport taxi or bus.  The airport taxis will take
you directly to the house but are fairly expensive - you should
expect to pay around &#163;20 for the journey.  Alternatively you
could get the airport bus into the centre of Edinburgh and then get a
taxi or a bus to the flat.  Most taxis in Edinburgh are black cabs
which you can either pick up from a taxi rank or wave at madly in the
street.  They will stop for you provided the orange light on the front
is switched on.  You should still expect to pay around &#163;5 or
maybe more (depends on the time of day among other things) to get from
the city centre to the flat by taxi.

</p>
<p>

The airport bus (service No. <a href='http://www.lothianbuses.co.uk/services/airlink.htm'>100</a>)
runs a frequent and fast service into the centre of
town.  The final stop is on Waverley Bridge, beside the train station,
and there is a taxi rank just opposite the bus stop.  

</p>
<p>

The number <a href='http://www.lothianbuses.co.uk/planner/_timetables/R42.asp'>42</a>
bus goes from the centre of Edinburgh to the King's Buildings campus.
It costs 80 pence and you must have the correct money as the buses
don't give change.  This bus leaves from the side of the National
Gallery on Princes Street - it's a big building with lots of columns
and is difficult to miss! (From the airport bus stop, walk up to
Princes Street, the main street, turn left, keeping Princes Street
Gardens, the park, on your left side, and take the first road to your
left, which is The Mound.  You will soon see a bus stop from which you
can catch the number 42 bus). If you ask the driver, they'll tell you
when you get to Kings Buildings.

</p>
<p>

If you get off the bus in Mayfield Road where the driver tells you,
walk to the crossroads and you will see the King's Buildings campus on
the far right corner.  

</p>
<p>

To get to EPCC, carry straight on for about 200 metres till you get to Gate 4 on the
right hand side of the road.  Turn right onto the campus and walk about 150 metres to
the James Clerk Maxwell Building.  Go into the building and ask the receptionist to
direct you to EPCC.

</p>
<p>

To get to the flat, turn right into West Mains Road, keeping the campus
on your left side, and walk along until you come to Gate 1 (this is the   
second gate, coming from Mayfield Road. The  flats are immediately on your
right. If you go down the side closest to the road the doors have got
buzzers on and are numbered. 64/3 means street number 64,
flat 3 - this is the first set of flats you come to, and flat 3 will
be on the first floor.

</B></font>

<p>

The week beginning Monday 2 July is completely taken up with
an introductory course. The aim of the course is to give you all a
common base of knowledge which will allow you to relate to each other's
work during the summer. We also hope that by providing this course, we
will reduce the amount of time staff have to spend later in the
summer, explaining tools and utilities to you one at a time. 
</p>

<p>
<em>The course begins in the JCMB Computational Physics Lab (JCMB
room number 3203) at 0930 on Monday 2 July</em>. 
</p>

<p>
There will be
signposts to the room from the main entrance of JCMB.
</p>


<p>
The provisional programme is:

</table>

<p>
This is mandatory for those with an OpenMP-based project but will be open to any
others who wish to attend.
</p>

<p>
The contents of the modules in the above schedule will be the `cherry-picked' best and
most relevant parts of the longer courses of the same name.
</p>

<p>
The detailed training schedule is <a href='training.html'>here</a>. Note, this is
still in draft form...
</p>

</p>

On the first day you will break for coffee at around 11am. This will
give an opportunity for you all to meet your supervisors briefly. We
<em>may</em> also take the opportunity of taking a group photograph at
this point. These will be used in the Newsletter, and possibly in
future publicity material for the Programme. 

</p>
<p>

You will notice that the afternoon of Thursday 5 July is free - this will give those
of you who need a bank account and who have not opened one, a chance to do so.  The
University branch of the Bank of Scotland will allow you to open an account even
though you are only here for 10 weeks (most banks would be reluctant to allow you to
do this).  For those of you who already have UK bank accounts, this will provide an
opportunity for you to have a longer meeting with your supervisor to discuss your
project.

</p>
<p>

We will finish the training period during the 2nd week with some kind of social event,
though quite what is undecided at the time of writing - probably a barbecue - we will
let you know! Also, at odd times during the programme we'd expect there to be frisbee
and/or football (soccer) during one or two of the evenings. Again, look out for
details.

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Subsequent Weeks</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

<strong>Working Hours:</strong> There are no formal hours which you are expected
to work, although we expect each of you to put in a full working week
of at least 35 hours. For the vast majority of students, this has not
proven to be a problem in the past. Your supervisors have to satisfy
themselves that you are putting in an appropriate amount of work. Note
that this includes encouraging any over-zealous students to go home
occasionally!

</p>
<p>

<strong>Lunchtime Meetings:</strong> During the second last week of the SSP you
  will be asked to present your work in a lunchtime seminar. Each
  student will be expected to provide their supervisor with a copy of
  their slides the day before the presentation, and the supervisor will
  be expected to provide the student with feedback on the presentation.
  The supervisors of students presenting at a particular meeting will
  normally attend that meeting. 

</p>
<p>

<strong>5:15 Reports:</strong> Each week, you will be expected to produce a
one-page report describing your work that week and your plans for the
rest of the project. These reports are called 5:15 reports to remind
everyone that they should take 5 minutes to read and 15 minutes to
write. You will be expected to submit copies of your report to your
supervisor and the co-ordinator by 5:15 on Friday afternoons.  This
provides us with a means of keeping track of the progress of each
project during the summer, and helps you focus on the progress you
make each week. Here is a template for your reports:

</code>
</p>
<p>

<strong>Social Activities:</strong> One of the strengths of the SSP in previous
years has been the amount of time that the students and staff spend
together away from EPCC. This will hopefully be a feature of this
year's programme too, and we would encourage you to become as actively
involved as possible in any social activities arranged.

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Reports</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

You will be expected to produce a written report describing the work
that you have carried out during the summer.  A LaTeX template for
this report is already installed in your cluster account in the <code>report</code>
 directory and we will provide some information on how to use
LaTeX for those of you who haven't encountered it before.  Reports
should be between 10 and 20 pages in length, and should be of an
appropriate standard to be published as an EPCC technical note.  To
attain this standard you will need to plan your report carefully in
conjunction with your supervisor.  Your supervisor will be responsible
for providing you with feedback on drafts of the report.  Once your
supervisor is satisfied with the report, it should be passed on to the
co-ordinators for final editing and inclusion in the set of summer
student reports.  <em>You will not receive your final pay cheque until we
are satisifed with your report.</em>

</p>
<p>

To help you in this process we are asking you to hand in a skeleton
report at the end of your 7th week with us, <em>i.e.</em> by Friday 17
August). This should contain section headings for your final report, a
fairly full version of your introduction, and a complete section on the
background to your project. A paper copy of this initial version of your
report should be given to your supervisor (if you have more than one
supervisor, work out with them whether they all want a copy or will pass
one copy round) and to the co-ordinator by the end of normal working
hours (5pm) on that Friday - once the co-ordinator has a copy
you will receive your pay-cheque for that week.  Reports will be
returned to you with comments as soon as possible.

</p>
<p>

It has been our experience that students often leave too little time
to write up properly, and so we hope that by forcing you to outline
your report and write one major section of it we will get you started
into the whole process earlier. We estimate that for the outline and
final reports together you should spend at least a week, full-time,
writing. Having you submit an outline report will also give us a
chance to provide you with feed-back on your writing style so that the
final report can be of high quality.

</p>
<p>

To some extent, the 5:15 reports will provide a record of your work
during the summer, although you may wish to keep a more detailed log
book of your work, including design and implementation decisions for
example, for later use in your write-up. Final reports should reach
the co-ordinator at least two working days before you leave, to allow
time for any final corrections to be made.

</p>
<p>

Note your reports should be partly descriptive of the main stages you
have gone through (``I did this, then I did that''), but more
importantly should describe the methods used and results obtained in
the work you have done. A typical set of section headings might be:

</p>

<ul>
<li>   Introduction
<li>   Background
<li>   Description of approach taken, problems encountered, etc.
<li>   Results obtained
<li>   Conclusion
<li>   References
</ul>

<p>

These are for guidance only - you may well want to split up the sections
in the middle more.

</p>
<p>

Please use the <code>report</code> directory for your reports, leave that
directory world readable, and make sure that copies of any diagrams
used in the report are all contained in that one directory - we will
copy that directory at the end of the summer, and want to be able to
automate the process...

<p>

During the second last week of the SSP (week beginning 27 August) you will be asked to
present your work in a lunchtime seminar. Each student will be expected to provide
their supervisor with a copy of their slides the day before the presentation, and the
supervisor will be expected to provide the student with feedback on the presentation.
The supervisors of students presenting at a particular meeting will normally attend
that meeting.  

</p>

<p>

The schedule for this years presentations is <a

<p>

EPCC usually holds a Seminar during September at which all students display a
poster summary of their project.  This year there will not be an Annual
Seminar as EPCC is organizing the UKHEC Annual Seminar (<a
href='http://www.ukhec.ac.uk/events/annual2001/'>Next Generation HPC Systems and the Grid</a>), which will be held on
10/11 September, just after the SSP ends.  However we will still ask SSP
students to produce posters towards the end of the Programme, for display in
EPCC.

</p>
<p>

Exact details of what will be required in a poster will be circulated
during the summer. As with reports, your supervisor will be
responsible for initial quality-control of your poster, before they
are passed on to the co-ordinator.  Posters should also reach the
co-ordinator several days before the end of the Programme, to allow
time for any final corrections to be made.

</p>
<p>

A LaTeX template for your poster is already installed in your account, in the
<code>poster</code> directory.  Please use the <code>poster</code> directory
for your poster, leave that directory world readable, and make sure that
copies of any diagrams used in the poster are all contained in that one
directory.

<p>
The information contained in this section is broadly based on e-mails
sent to past students during the summer - hopefully concentrating the
most important bits of that information in one place will be helpful.

<A NAME="help"></a>

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Getting Help</H2>
</B></font>

<p>
This section contains <em>essential</em> information on who you should
contact for help with the machines if something goes wrong or if you
need to find out more information.

</p>
<p>

First, the HPC (High Performance Computing) resources - the Sun SMP cluster, the T3E, 
and any other machines to which you may have access.  If you have a problem, or if you
need access to manuals for information that your supervisor can't get for you, then
e-mail <code>SSP-Support@ed.ac.uk</code>.  Your query will be dealt with as soon as
possible, and you should at least receive an acknowledgement that your query is being
dealt with within four to six hours during the working week.

</p>
<p>

Next, ancilliary equipment such as EPCC printers and servers (including
<code>garnet</code>.  If something goes
wrong - such as a device or server crashing so you can't use it, or a printer
hanging, then mail <code>support@epcc.ed.ac.uk</code> - this will be sorted
out as quickly as possible if it is a genuine fault.  However, if you
are just using some program wrongly then you are more likely to get a
message saying ``RTFM'' or ``Read the (Expletive) Manual.''

</p>
<p>

Unix provides extensive on-line documentation via the
manual pages. Entering the command <br><br>

<code>man <em>command</em></code> <br><br>

provides the definitive information
on <code><em>command</em></code>.  For example:<br><br>

<code>man -k PostScript</code><br><br>

 provides a list of the manual
pages which relate to <code>PostScript</code>.  

</p>
<p>

Try and find out what you want by using these facilities before
contacting <code>support</code>. When accessing the EPCC machines via machines
operated by the Edinburgh University Computing Service (EUCS), notably
the X-Lab machines, and reporting faults if you are remotely logged in,
please make sure the EUCS end is working before telling <code>support</code>
something is wrong. 

</p>
<p>

Finally, if you have run out of disk space on <code>garnet</code>
(for work purposes, and don't have megabytes of personal stuff in your
account), or are wondering whether a particular utility is available,
or similar, e-mail <code>support@epcc.ed.ac.uk</code> and ask them. Note --
this is not the same as <code>SSP-Support@ed.ac.uk</code>, and has nothing
to do with the parallel machines, so don't ask parallel questions of
<code>support</code>.

</p>
<p>

<strong>Please remember that for most of your project related queries
    your best source of information will be your supervisor so ask
    them first!</strong>

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Workstation access from the Computational Physics Lab/EUCS PC-Lab machines</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

The Computational Physics Lab is likely to be your main base during
the summer.  From these machines you will be able to log in via a pull-down menu to
<code>garnet</code> (or <code>holyrood</code>). From either of these, you should be
able to login to any of the EPCC machines necessary
for your project.

</p>

<p>

Now you should be able to use the EPCC facilities as normal, and
utilities like emacs should display on your workstation in the CP Lab.

</p>
<p>

Some final points - the CP Lab is a public access workstation room, and is
<em>not</em> for the exclusive use of the EPCC Summer Scholarship
Programme. Other people use this room, so please ensure that if you
are using it you don't ``hog'' the machines. Don't leave bags and
coats lying around there, unless you are actually in the room
working. All the normal ``not eating and drinking in workstation
rooms'' rules apply. Be sensible!

</p>


<p>

The EUCS Public Access lab has PCs.  We are still clarifying the log-in procedure
for these machines - further information will be circulated during the
first week of the SSP.

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Sensible Machine Use</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

Some brief points about sensible machine use: First, you will probably find in the few
days after the course that you may not be able to log in to some machines which you
were able to access during the courses. This is OK, and is quite deliberate. For most
of the summer you should be using <code>garnet</code> for editing etc., and
only the machines necessary to carry out your project.

</p>

<p>

Do not indulge in peripheral activities such as reading mail, news, using Netscape,
etc. on any machines except <code>garnet</code> (or <code>holyrood</code>.  Try and
minimise such activities in any case. However, this is not a complete ban - for
instance, the newsgroup <code>comp.parallel</code> might be of interest to you, and
browsing the Web can be a useful way of finding information.  However, reading
news/net surfing/etc.  do {\bf not} count as valid excuses for not getting your work
done!

</p>

<p>

We'll be keeping an eye on the loading of all machines - if the load
is too high, then ``sidelines'' will be banned completely, so it is in
your best interest to use the resources at your disposal sensibly.

<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Graphics</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

If your project will require graphics, <em>please</em> let us know well
in advance. AVS, which is covered in the visualisation course, is
relatively easy to support, but it helps scheduling staff time if we
know in advance. More complex facilities, such as video and/or OpenGL
graphics <em>must</em> be discussed with your supervisor and the
co-ordinator as early as possible - a few weeks' notice may be required
to make sure staff time is available to show you how to use the
available equipment and documentation. Please draw this to your
supervisor's attention if you are unsure.

</p>

<A NAME="photocopying"></a>
<font face='Futura,Arial,Helvetica' color='#a51042'><B>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><img align="top" border=0 src="../images/up.gif"></a> Photocopying and Printing</H2>
</B></font>

<p>

The cost of all of your work-related copying and printing is covered
as part of the scholarship programme. However, you <em>must</em> write
down in the loose-leaf folders by the printers (in rooms 3414 and
2251) any copying and printing you do.

</p>
<p>

Please try and minimise the amount you do - we are fond of trees!
There is 2-sided option on the photocopier which your supervisor will
be able to show you. You can also get the laser-printers to print 2 or
more pages to a sheet, shrinking the images - a good way to print a
longish document is:

</p>
<p>

<code>lpr -Plw34 -Z2up doc.ps+</code>

</p>
<p>

You can use the copiers and printers for personal copying, as long as it
is not excessive, and you pay for it. If you copy or print something for
yourself, mark it as ``Personal'' in the record folders, and we'll add
up all the copying etc. you need to pay for at the end of the summer: 4p
per laser printed sheet, 2p per photocopy, 10p for every incoming fax
page, 30p for every outgoing fax page (UK), and 50p for every outgoing
fax page (international).
