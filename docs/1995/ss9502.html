<H1>
Discrete Particle and Continuum Modelling of Particulate Solids
</H1>
<p>

This research is to serve as part of a three year project supported by
the EPSRC.  The aim of the project is to compare discrete particle and
continuum computational models for the behaviour of particulate solids
in silos.  To ensure that the findings have wide acceptance, it is
being undertaken as a major international collaboration effort, with
many discrete element and continuum (finite element) modellers around
the world attempting a series of standard problems.  Thus, many
different formulations of each model type will be used, chiefly
because there is little agreement between research groups on which
features are necessary to achieve a reasonable modelling.

<p>

Practical application of discrete element method (DEM) has been
hampered with traditional sequential processing computers. Realistic
discrete element simulations for particulate flows in silos require
considerable amount of computer time. This is particularly true in
three dimensional discrete element analysis that can use up enormous
amounts of computer time. Many researchers are devoting to achieving a
more efficient discrete element computation. Significant speed-up is
possible by exploiting the inherent parallelism in the time
integration of the discrete element models and the use of parallel
computers.

<H2> Existing DEM programs </H2>

Two sets of DEM code written in F77 are available in the Silos
Research Group, one based on grid search contact detection algorithm
and the other on linked-list algorithm. Both have been developed for
sequential processing computers.

<H2> Proposal </H2>

The most time consuming part of the operation, contact detection, can
be parallelised. This can be achieved by using the inherent
parallelism in discrete element analysis. When the computational
domain of interest is subdivided into a number of subregions, these
subregions can be processed in parallel. In this form of parallel
implementation, each subregion is assigned to one processor. All the
operations within the subregion, including the contact detection, are
performed in parallel. The data needed for computations in each
processor are either available in that processor or in the processors
representing the surrounding subregions. This type of nearest
neighbour data transfer makes the best possible use of inter-processor
communication.

<p>

The practical objective of the scholarship is to port one of these DEM
modelling programs from Fortran 77 to a suitable 'parallelised'
version (e.g. HPF) (3-5 weeks). From here it would be used to
calculate results for the various standard examples being used as part
of the international project.(3-5 weeks). A final (optional) step
would be the porting of the second program to a similar 'parallelised'
version and generating results for the standard models using this
second system.

<H2> Foreseeable significance and applications </H2>

As part of a major on-going research project, co-operating with many
leading researchers throughout the world, the proposed project for
parallelism of the existing DEM codes will be very meaningful for
enhancing the capability of existing techniques. There will be a very
good chance to expose the advent of the effective use of the
supercomputer for civil engineering problems.

<p>

The modified discrete element simulation code will allow a major step
forward to the more realistic simulations of particulate solids in
silos. It will also allow this university to be at the leading edge of
the research field and make significant contribution to the
particulate flows and silo structure research.
