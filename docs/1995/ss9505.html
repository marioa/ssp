<p>

There is an extensive literature on the dynamics of childhood
infectious diseases such as measles and chickenpox, and an appropriate
mathematical model for the effect of the disease in an isolated
population is generally accepted. However, there is growing
recognition that in the modern world even island populations cannot be
considered as isolated. Hence the importance of spatial factors and in
particular the linkage between populations caused by migration has
been of recent interest to those modelling disease dynamics. Grenfell
et al. investigate the effect of migration of a small number of
infectious individuals between ten distinct populations. They found
that the course of the disease in the various populations grow more
similar in time. This increased synchrony means that the model
predicts common (and unrealistic) die-out of the disease.

<p>

The proposed project would also investigate the course of the disease
in a set of populations. However these populations would have defined
spatial positions: i .e. they would be at the vertices of a square
lattice. In contrast to Grenfell et al. however, a migrating person
would not be equally likely to move to any of the other populations;
moves to near neighbours will be more likely than long distance jumps.
The initial object of the study will be to investigate whether
Grenfell et al.'s qualitative observations are preserved in this
modified model. Grenfell et al. also assume that all the populations
were identical in size. We would also investigate whether relaxing
this assumption changes model predictions.  If time allowed, the
additional synchronising effect of seasonal variation in some model
parameters would also be investigated.

<p>

Technical aspects of the project can vary depending on the interests
and ability of the student. The traditional model describing the
dynamics of the disease in an isolated population is a set of four
ordinary differential equations. Solving these (with migration terms
added) simulataneously on each lattice node in the model would be
relatively simple. However recent work on modelling the disease in
isolated populations use stochastic models which generate events
probabilistically. Implementing a network of these populations
efficently in a parallel environment would be much more challanging.
Both approaches could be justified and comparison between them would
be of interest in itself.
