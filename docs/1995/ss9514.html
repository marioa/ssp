<h1>
Record Based File System using MPI with Distributed Lock and Cache Management
</H1>
<p>

Many scientific and commercial applications when ported to MPP
platforms are found to be I/O bound. That is, they spend too much of
their time waiting for data to become available before processing can
proceed. In many cases the dataset will be too large to fit into the
available memory. Therefore, global pre-fetching of the data is not an
option.

<p>

Common solutions to the problem of parallel file access require that
one or more processors act as servers. These servers answer requests
from the other processors, and do no actual computation themselves. A
problem with this solution is that the server processors can rapidly
become saturated with requests, thus slowing down the entire MPP
system.

<p>

The aim of this project was to distribute the server function across
all the processes in a program, thus spreading the load evenly. As
well as the distributed file access, record caching was also to be
supported on all processors.

<p>

All of the inter processor communication is via MPI. Whilst this
ensures a high degree of portability, it also rules out a preemptive
solution, and requires all processors to regularly check for pending
I/O requests.

<p>

The basic aims of the project were therefore:
<UL>
<LI>    To design and implement a small set of I/O subroutines to open
        and close files, and to read, write, lock, and unlock records
        using MPI. 
<LI>	To implement record caching, thereby reducing the amount of disk
     	access, and hopefully resulting in a performance increase.
</UL>

Performance of these routines was measured on a T800 based transputer,
and on a Cray T3D. As a simple test of the functions, a parallel bubble
sorting program was written, whereby all operations were performed to
and from disk rather than memory. 

<p>

The performance was seen to scale well with the number of processors,
resulting in a speed up of four when the number of processors was scaled
from one to eight. When caching was also included, a further speed up of
around two and a half was measured. These timings are extremely
dependant on the exact program being used, but it is likely that similar
trends should be observed in other utilisations of the Record Based File
System.
