<H1>
Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Parallel Searching
</H1>

<p>

The TLG is a collection of electronic texts available on CD-ROM. The
texts run to some 60 million words and take up about 550 megabytes.
They comprise most of Ancient Greek literature. Many authors are
included. The texts are of interests to Classicists, historians,
experts on literature and language, and to those studying biblical
Greek and the Greek Church Fathers. The proposers main interest is in
New Testament, but the project would assist all the other fields also.

<p>

At present the texts can be searched either on a specialist micro
(Ibycus system) or on a 486 using special software (Lbase, TLG
Workplace, Musaios, etc.). These searches are quite good for a small
group of authors but take at least 40 minutes to search the whole
corpus - and that is at best using the Ibycus. Parallel searching
should allow the researcher a much faster time. The main aim of
searching is to match a set of words or part-words. It is also
sometimes useful to search via the index, especially where rarer words
are involved.

<p>

Various search strategies could be used. The special software on the
non-standard PC the Ibycus, gets good results at speeds better than is
done with a 486. The search routines for that use boolean operators
<I>and</I> and <I>or</I> and allow either whole or part words to be
used. The texts contain accents and breathings. These need to be
ignored when specifying the search pattern and when searching, but
displayed when the results are shown, and put in the result file. A
better wild card facility would improve searching, as would the
inclusion of a <I>not</I> operator. Ibycus allows the span of a search
to be modified between 3 and 200 characters. Searches need to
overshoot line, sentence and some other divisions of the text.

<p>

Basically it is word searching of a huge text which is being done.
There are non-parallel search routines such as <i>grep</I> and the
commands in <I>ecce</I> which might provide some ideas on the sort of
routines to include. Whether any of the providers of software for the
TLG would collaborate or whether the project would wish to be tied to
any such software groups would need to be explored.

<p>

The corpus of texts could be split into segments in some way thus
allowing parallel searching to speed up the whole process very
considerably. That would be the new factor here. It would be best to
try not to make a solution dependent on one piece of hardware which
might have a limited life or be available in only a few sites.

<p>

The search results would need to be passed to a system (on a 486?)
which could display them and allow them to be included in Word for
Windows 6 format using special fonts for Greek. Or some alternative to
this would be needed, but this would be the current preference.
