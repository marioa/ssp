<p>

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) permit the storage, display and
manipulation of spatially referenced data. Continued rapid growth in
the availability of digital cartographic data and satellite images is
creating a demand for intensive computing to integrate and process
large datasets. Such datasets can be collected and integrated from a
wide variety of sources, including geological, political and census
databases. This information can then be used to solve problems in
areas such as environmental assessment, transportation, marketing,
distribution, telecommunications, planning and resource management.

<p>

GIS processing is both computationally and I/O intensive. This makes
GIS an ideal application for parallel processing, where performance
and I/O can be increased in a modular and scalable way. Consequently
the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, in partnership with the
Department of Geography, has developed GIS systems that exploit
parallel processing technology.

<p>

A scalable, extensible, parallel library of core GIS operations has
been designed and partly implemented to interface to some of the major
commercial GIS packages.  These core operations are polygon overlay,
and conversion between raster and vector data formats.

<p>

These core operations have been designed in a modular fashion enabling
the substantial reuse of code segments. Full parallel designs have
been produced for all components of all operations.

<p>

The proposed Summer Student projects involve redesign and
implementation of the vector data input module to use MPI instead of
CHIMP.  The projects also involve implementation of the outstanding
components in this module.

<p>

The vector data input module performs the pre-processing and
distribution of vector data necessary for both the polygon overlay and
vector-to-raster conversion operations.  Indeed similar processing and
distribution of vector data is required by most vector GIS operations.
This module is therefore an important building block for parallel GIS
operations other than just polygon overlay and vector-to-raster
conversion operations.  It also necessary for operations such as
vector topology creation, buffer generation and generalisation.

<p>

The vector data input module comprises three sub-phases :
<UL>
<LI>	<b>Sort</b> This extracts the data necessary for the operations from
     	the input datasets.  This data is then processed and sorted before
     	output to PUL-PF files.
<LI>	<b>Join</b> The data output by Sort are merge-sorted and combined.
<LI>	<b>Geom Attribute Distribution (GAD)</b> This takes the data out by
     	Join and decomposes and distributes to Worker processes for Polygon
     	Overlay or Vector-to-Raster conversion.
</UL>

All three sub-phases involve parallel processing of GIS data and
significant use of PUL-PF and PUL-active buffers.

<p>

These sub-phases have been designed and partially implemented using
CHIMP.  Detailed design documents and pseudo-code also exist.  All
code is written in C.  Two summer student projects would assist
greatly in completing the implementation of the vector data input
module.  Once complete the vector data input module could be
integrated with the Topology, Stitching and Output module currently
being implemented by the Department Of Geography to produce a vector
topology creation operation.  Also by integrating the prototype
polygon overlay module as well, a complete polygon overlay operation
could be produced.  This would therefore be amongst the first, if not
the first, modular parallel GIS operations in the world and would
represent a significant step in creating a library of parallel GIS
operations.  As such the results of the projects would be publishable
in academic journals.

<p>

The project involves the following stages:

<UL>
<LI>    MPI training and familiarisation with parallel GIS project and
        its coding conventions. 
<LI>    Redesign Sort sub-phase message passing using MPI instead of
        CHIMP.  Also assess impact of MPI implementation of PUL-PF and
        redesign accordingly.
<LI>    Implement redesigned Sort sub-phase integrating this with
        existing code on geom processing.
<LI>    Redesign Join sub-phase message passing using MPI instead of
        CHIMP and assess impact of MPI implementation of PUL-PF and
        PUL-active buffers and redesign accordingly.
<LI>    Implement redesigned Join sub-phase integrating this with
        existing code.
</UL>
