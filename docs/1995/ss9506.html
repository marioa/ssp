OCHRE-P: Optical Character Recognition in Parallel
</H1>
<p>

This project involved the development of a fast and accurate prototype
OCR system to meet the needs of high-volume document processing
applications such as forms processing.

<P>

OCR is not yet in widespread use in such applications because of the
heavy computational demand of accuracte OCR. Parallel computing can
help to change this by:

<UL>
  <LI> increasing raw throughput.
  <LI> making more accurate but more computationally intensive
       algorithms practical.
</UL>

<P>

A number of parallelisation strategies were evaluated and a prototype
OCR system called OCHRE-P modelled on a task farming paradigm was
implemented. The parallel framework used lines of text as the unit of
decomposition.

<p>

A feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer was used for
pattern classification. Using a novel boundary scanning technique
along with a scaled bitmap to provide the input feature vector, a
recognition accuracy of around 97% was obtained for correctly
segmented upper-case letters from a variety of fonts, including some
that did not form part of the training set.

<P>

Parallel performance on a cluster of seven Ethernet workstations and
on a Transputer Computing Surface were compared: the shared bus
architecture of the cluster delivered near-optimal scalability (see
Figure) and would seem to be more suited to this problem.

This suggests that a high performance OCR system could be designed
relatively cheaply using industry standard PCs and an inexpensive
local area network.

<p>

Possible extensions to the work were also considered.
