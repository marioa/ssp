<H1>
Teaching High Performance Computing via the World Wide Web
</H1>


<p>

The Web is currently exciting much interest in the media as well as
the scientific community. If it is to fulfil its potential, it is
essential that it is put to practical use, not just for entertainment.
As the nature of work and Universities change, there is much interest
in distance learning material, enabling students to work and learn in
their own time. Already, programmes in the US exist, targeted solely
at writing such materials and using the Web as the main means of
delivery. As a leading HPC centre, it is important that EPCC is
involved in the production and delivery of distance learning
materials.

<p>

We would like to explore various possibilities to use the WWW to
promote the awareness and use of HPC. As part of the EPCC Training and
Education Centre~(EPCC-TEC), we are involved in investigating new
techniques for teaching HPC skills. We already use the WWW to
disseminate course material and reports and we have already put the
MPI course notes up in HTML format. We are currently looking at
producing an interactive version of the MPI course using the EPIC
(EPcc Interactive Courseware) package produced by Martin Westhead. The
aim is that people could transfer a file to their local space and have
a version of the course complete with a set of interactive
exercises. These exercises can be edited, compiled and run on a local
machine with the various processes controlled by the EPIC package.

<p>

It would be interesting and useful to do something similar for another
course. We should concentrate on courses which are useful locally for
training new staff and/or TRACS visitors. Possibilities include: 

<UL>
<LI>  High Performance Fortran 
<LI>  Scientific Visualisation: A Practical Introduction 
<LI>  Introduction to Computational Science 
</UL>

The course(s) chosen could depend on the background and interests of
the student. As well as translating at least some of the course
examples to HTML/EPIC format, we would hope that the student would be
able to come up with exercises which might be more suited to WWW or
with better methods of presentation.

<p>

Another task, if the time were available, would be to consider other
ways to use WWW to promote HPC skills. This is a more open-ended task
and might require some lateral thinking.

<p>

<H2>Proposed Workplan</H2>

<UL>
<LI>	Week  1:   Training Course
<LI>	Week  2:   Investigating WWW and learning HTML
<LI>	Week  3:   Surveying the available WWW teaching materials
<LI>	Week  4:   Trying out `MPI on WWW', and a short report on
	(dis)advantages of WWW for teaching
<LI>	Weeks 5-8: Producing HTML version of (parts of) chosen course(s)
<LI>	Weeks 9:   Explore other uses of WWW (another short report)
<LI>	Week 10:   Report
</UL>

<p>

While there is useful project work to be done in translating an
existing course onto WWW, this is not the only worthwhile activity.
(Indeed, this task could be completed by a member of EPCC-TEC after
the summer, allowing significant flexibility depending on the rate of
progress of the student.) Perhaps more importantly, we are very
interested in any ideas the student discovers which could improve our
use of WWW. The deliverables would include course exercises on the WWW
and two short reports as described above.

<p>

In summary, the production of training materials for WWW is a new and
exciting area and could provide a Summer Scholarship Student with an
interesting and achievable project.
