<b>Name?</b> Ben, "And it's BEN on my birth certificate" McNally.

<p>

<b>Birthday?</b> 6/7/73, and a typical Cancerian.

<p>

<b>Early History?</b> Born in Tring, England. Moved to Bangor,
Northern Ireland at the age of three. Lived there until the age of
ten, at which point he moved again. This time to Helensburgh,
Scotland.

<p>

<b>Quite well travelled then?</b> Oh, and he was conceived in Germany.

<p>

<b>What did he get up to in Secondary School?</b> Just the usual
stuff; Forced to play rugby in deepest winter, learnt how to make hot
chocolate in home economics and watched West Side Story in music.

<p>

<b>Any more signs of internationalism?</b> Afraid not. He once got
0/15 in a German oral exam.

<p>

<b>So what was he good at?</b> Ben enjoyed science best. He and his
friends took particular pleasure in tormenting their teacher with
questions like, "How do clams mate?" and, "Do you hear the sonic boom
in Concorde?".

<p>

<b>I bet his teachers loved him!</b> ...But little did they realise
there were still another three McNallys to get through the system.

<p>

<b>Why did he choose Computational Physics at University?</b> "Choose"
is definitely the wrong word. He initially enrolled for Physics and
Computer Science, but cleverly dropped the Computer Science part in
Freshers week. Then in second year, during a Fortran practical, his
tutor said, 'Would you like to change to Computational Physics?"

<p>

<b>And the rest is history?</b> Please! Don't write him off just yet!
Ben is about to start an Image Processing PhD in King's
College. There's still a lot of debugging left in the old boy yet.

<p>

<b>Any burning ambitions?</b> Only to play rag time guitar.

<p>

<b>Most likely to say...</b> Phwooar! Look at the kerning on that!

<p>

<b>Least likely to say...</b> If a tree falls in a wood, and no one's
around, does anyone really care?

<p>
