<H1>A Skeleton Project Proposal</H1> 

<P>

If you are interested in submitting a project proposal, please supply
the following information:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Project Title</B> Title here <p>
       
  <LI> <B>Proposers</b> Who are you? <p>

  <LI> <B>Suggested EPCC Contact</b> Do you know anyone in EPCC who
  might be interested in helping? <p>

  <LI> <B>Project Summary</b>

       A brief description of the proposed project. One side of A4,
       including any significant background, and an outline of the
       main tasks and goals. It is important to give as clear a
       workplan as possible, including let-outs for less able
       students, and extra work for those that make faster than
       expected progress. Even something at the level of: after 2
       weeks the student will have read the papers and existing code,
       after 5 have done a design for the parallel code, after 8
       written and tested the parallel code. Remember that though this
       is a 10-week programme, the first week is taken up with an
       intensive training course and that we generally reckon on
       allocating all of the final week to report and poster
       preparation. <p>

  <LI> <B>Expertise Required</b>           

       What expertise is required from the student? Do they require a
       lot of knowledge of the subject area? Or are strong computing
       skills more important? Leave blank if you are not sure. <p>

  <LI> <B>Resources Required</b>

       What machines might the project be aimed at? Workstations?
       Cray?  etc. What parallel environment --- MPI,
       CM-Fortran,~\ldots? Are there any software packages or
       data-sets that would need to be made available? <p>

  <LI> <B>Resources Supplied</b>

       What code or data would you be able to supply? E.g. an existing
       code that you would like to attempt to parallelise to handle
       larger data-sets. <p>
       
  <LI> <B>References</b>
 
       If applicable. <p>

</UL>

<P>

Proposals will be assessed in February - March for technical merit,
novelty, and match with the available student skills. Note that this
date is significantly earlier than last year to allow us more time to
work through proposals with you before the final selection is made.
Proposals should reach EPCC by 31st January 1996, ideally as ASCII
text or LaTeX sent to the <i>epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk</i> account. If you
have any questions, please e-mail (preferred, at the above address) or
phone EPCC (ask for Colin Brough or Elspeth Minty). We look forward to
hearing from you soon.

<p>

Please address any queries (by email) to <I> epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk </I>
or (by fax) to +44 (0)131 650 6555, marked for the attention of the
Summer Scholarship Co-ordinator.
