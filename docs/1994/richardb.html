Richard is from Portstewart, Northern Ireland, and is currently
studying for a degree in Civil Engineerng at Edinburgh University.
This is due to be completed by June 1995.

<p>

In his spare time, Richard is a keen table tennis player, and has had
the opportunity to play on the university table-tennis team. Also he
is actively involved in the Christian Union, having been in a
leadership position and taken part in various activities.

<p>

Outside the university, since coming to Edinburgh, Richard has taken
the opportunity to get involved with Scripture Union, a Christian
organisation who hold camps/mission for young children which he has
found both challenging and rewarding.

<p>

In working for EPCC on their summer scholarship programme, he has
become more aware of the use of computers in Civil Engineering. It is
his intention to pursue a career in a computing aspect of Civil
Engineering. He is currently considering doing a MSc. in Computational
Engineering, in order to develop his computing skills.
