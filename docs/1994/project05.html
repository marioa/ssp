Host Plant Selection by Turnip Root Flies
</H1>

Turnip root flies are plant feeding insects. The adult fly is highly
mobile and oviposits, lays eggs, at the base of host plants, the eggs
hatch and the larvae then feed on the roots of the brassica plants
concerned.  The host selection process is quite complex, the adult
lands on the leaf of the potential host plant and then proceeds to
examine the surface of the leaf, stem and base of the plant prior to
laying eggs if the plant is suitable.  If the host plant appears
unsuitable at any stage in the host selection process the female fly
rejects the plant and flies off to find another plant.
<P>

In addition to the suitability of the plant, the physiological status
of the fly is of great importance.  Throughout their reproductive
life, the female flies produce a number of eggs each day.  It is an
excepted facet of host plant selection that as the period since the
fly last oviposited increases, the female fly becomes more likely to
lay eggs at any given encounter. Consequently, both the susceptibility
of a plant to oviposition and the distribution of plants within an
environment influence the extent to which eggs are laid upon them. The
applied element of this from a biological viewpoint is that a valuable
crop may be protected from an insect pest with a strip of highly
susceptible host plants. Eggs are laid in the band of susceptible
plants that are then destroyed, killing the pest.
<P>

By modelling the behaviour of a series of individuals it may be
possible to assess how the relative proporation of resistant and
susceptible plants affact the damage sustained by a crop during the
course of a growing season.
