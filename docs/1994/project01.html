Application Engineering Tools for MPI and PUL
</H1>
<BR>

This project is intended to follow on from a summer scholarship
project undertaken last year: "Applications Engineering Tools for
CHIMP and PUL".  This project involved two students working on a
post-mortem visualisation tool for the debugging and tuning of CHIMP
and PUL applications.  The resulting tool was capable of displaying
events and animating SAP-SAP communications generated by a CHIMP V1
application.  The work of the two students was divided between the two
key components of the tool: the trace-processing engine that builds a
structural representation of the execution of a parallel application
from trace files generated by the constituent processes; and the
graphical display framework, implemented using X/Motif operations
partly written by hand, and partly generated by the X interface
builder tool <I> XDesigner</I>.  It would be possible to preserve this
clean division of work, if two students were to undertake the proposed
follow-on project.
<P>

Due to the EPCC's policy to migrate message passing applications from
CHIMP to the MPI standard, it is intended to adapt the existing tool
to visualise MPI applications.  Since a commitment has also been made
to port the PUL utilities from CHIMP to MPI, the interface design for
the visualisation of PUL remains valid, although this has not yet been
implemented.
<P>

This work will require revision of the event trace file format and the
internal representation of events, to reflect the differences between
CHIMP and MPI communications.  Some redesign of the user interface
will also be required where specific features of CHIMP have been
exposed (especially differences in process grouping), and where MPI
offers novel features (e.g. process topologies).  Also, MPI comprises
collective communication operations which have been provided atop
CHIMP as part of the PUL-EM utility.  Thus, much of the visualisation
intended for PUL-EM will apply to MPI instead.  Profiling requirements
have been addressed by the MPI standard by specification of an
alternative interface to allow users to implement wrappers around
every MPI operation; this will be used to provide an instrumentation
library that will work correctly with all valid MPI implementations.
This should generate trace files suitable for the trace-processing
component of the visualisation tool.
<P>

Last year, the visualisation tool was evaluated using CHIMP
applications written as part of other SSP projects; this provided
valuable feedback to both projects.  Assuming that new SSP projects
will use MPI for message passing, similar evaluation effort will be
encouraged during development of the tool and during the concluding
assessment of the project.
<P>

The goals of the project could be ordered as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	implement MPI instrumentation library;  <P>
<LI>	adapt trace-processing and event representation;  <P>
<LI>	adapt CHIMP SAP group displays to MPI communicators;  <P>
<LI>	adapt CHIMP comms animation to MPI comms;  <P> 
<LI>	extend MPI comms animation to include collective comms;  <P>
<LI>	implement MPI process topology display;  <P>
<LI>	extend comms animation to include PUL-RD, TF, (SM), (GF),
	(PF). <P>
</UL>
