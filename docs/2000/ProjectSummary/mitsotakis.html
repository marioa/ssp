<H2>Visualisation of 2D and 3D Discrete Element Models using OpenGL</H2>

A Discrete Element Model (DEM) simulates the behaviour of a collection
of particles, typically interacting via a short-range force. The
simulation works at the level of individual particles and in real
cases many millions are typically required to get accurate
results. Examples include simulating snooker balls (a 2D DEM with
simple contact forces), the way ball bearings pack as they are emptied
into a box (a 3D DEM with complicated contact forces including
friction) or the fracturing behaviour of a crystal at the atomic level
(a 3D DEM with complicated short-range forces extending at least as
far as an atom's nearest neighbours). EPCC has been involved in many
projects involving parallel DEMs, and visualisation is always very
important, not least because animations of DEMs can be extremely
visually attractive as well as scientifically informative.  The
supervisor of this project is currently working with a DEM from the
Department of Physics, and would very much like animations of the
results.<P>

Each of the previous projects was visualised with a tailor-made solution
using either AVS or OpenGL. Although AVS is very flexible, it is rather
heavyweight for the straightforward task of rendering simple particles,
and it is not easy to do real-time animation with many particles. OpenGL
is a simple, portable and efficient standard for 3D graphics (and
actually underlies AVS), available on Unix and NT, which is ideal for
animation. The aim of this project is to develop a simple OpenGL
visualiser for DEMs that reads a file containg the particle positions as
a function of time and animates them. There are many possibilities for
adding interesting functionality, for example: colour-coding the
particles based on static or dynamic properties; leaving streamlines to
track a particle's motion; taking cuts through the data to reveal inner
structure; presenting the visualisation from the point of view of one of
the particles; adding visualisation of bonds; etc. etc. An important
by-product will be to develop more experience of OpenGL within EPCC, and
to make use of our visualisation hardware.<P>
