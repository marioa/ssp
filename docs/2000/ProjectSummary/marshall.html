<H2>Library Tools for Course Web Site Creators</H2>

<HR>
This is a proposal to EPCC from the SELLIC Project for assistance
through its summer scholarship programme. Two tools are proposed for
development as prototypes, using data from the Library's web-based
system, Endeavor Voyager (<A HREF="http://catalogue.lib.ed.ac.uk/">http://catalogue.lib.ed.ac.uk/</A>). These
tools are designed to facilitate the development of course web sites,
whether these are developed using a proprietary course builder package
such as WebCT (<A HREF="http://www.webct.com">http://www.webct.com</A>) or are 'hand made'. They take data
from the Library's web-based systems in order to populate appropriate
course web site pages. They do not allow academics directly to add,
amend or delete data in the Library's systems. They provide a means of
making library information available in the particular context of the
course web site, while not preventing that information continuing to be
made available from within the relevant Library system modules.<P>

The tools should be made available to academic staff from the SELLIC
web site, downloadable as icons in browser toolbars. They should be
standards-based, and we would expect that the Z39.50 information
retrieval protocol would be utilised in developing them.<P>

The tools to be developed will be available only to lecturers. The
descriptions below identify both the tools and the results as viewed by
students. Two tools are listed, and should be developed in the course
of the summer scholarship programme, as time permits. Development
should be in the order shown.<P>

<H4>Dynamic Reading List Manager</H4>

This tool interfaces with the library system to permit 'dynamic reading
lists' to be compiled by teaching staff directly from the Library OPAC
(Online Public Access Catalogue). It allows lecturers to link record
details from the OPAC directly to web sites. Web sites concerned may be
freely available within an intranet or may require authenticated access
(e.g. a web-based course management system such as WebCT). The reading
list should appear within the course web site, i.e. it should not
require users to link out of the course web site to access data about
reading list items, but should rather populate the page automatically
from the library system.<P>

<H4>Functions</H4>

<UL>
<LI>In the course web site, presents lecturers with a template web
  reading list document containing fields for lecturer name, course
  name and date</LI>

<LI>In the course web site, offers lecturers a view of the Library's web
  OPAC which permits records identified after a search in the OPAC to
  be tagged for inclusion in the reading list</LI>

<LI>In the course web site, allows tagged records to be submitted to the
  reading list document</LI>

<LI>Runs a background process to copy selected OPAC records to the web
  reading list document</LI>

<LI> Ensures that the web reading list can run a dynamic process in
  respect of each item to check on circulation status and holdings
  information, and that this process is automatically run each time
  the document is accessed by a student in the course web site</LI>
</UL>
    
<H4>Electronic Reserve Interface</H4>

This tool populates appropriate pages within a course web site with
data from the Library's electronic reserves module, and also permits
academic staff to nominate learning materials for digitisation to
Library staff. This tool permits both the identification of library
system items within a course web site environment and the ability to
request that particular items are added to the Electronic Reserve
module. The electronic reserve module is not yet deployed at this
University, but to see how it operates, look at the Auburn University
library system, which is an Endeavor Voyager system, at
<A HREF="http://eres.lib.auburn.edu/cgi-bin/eres/view.pl">http://eres.lib.auburn.edu/cgi-bin/eres/view.pl</A> (look under 'Library'
to find some non-password-protected materials). It is likely to be
deployed at Edinburgh from this summer.<P>

<H4>Functions</H4>

<UL><LI> In the course web site, allows academic staff to tag records in the
  Library's Electronic Reserve module</LI>

<LI>In the course web site, allows academic staff to submit the tagged
  records to a 'Course materials' document in the course web site, as
  live links from the Library system</LI>

<LI>Runs a background process to copy selected Electronic Reserve
  records to the 'Course materials' document</LI>

<LI>Ensures that the 'Course materials' document can run a dynamic
  process in respect of each item to refresh the information from the
  library system, and that this process is automatically run each time
  the document is accessed by a student in the course web site</LI>

<LI>In the course web site, provides a form interface to academic staff
  allowing them to nominate particular learning materials to be added
  to Electronic Reserve. This generates an email message to Library
  staff.</LI>
