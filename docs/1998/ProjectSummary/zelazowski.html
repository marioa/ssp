<H2>Benchmarking and related work on the Hitachi SR2201</H2>

As part of the project titled High Performance Java for the Hitachi
SR2201, Hitachi have donated a distributed memory parallel system with
8 processors, each of which feature 256Mb of memory. Up to this point,
Connor Mulholland and Lorna Smith have carried out a set of
benchmarking exercises on existing Cray T3D codes written in FORTRAN
and utilising the MPI message passing library. The results obtained
were compared with those of the Cray machines and a set of useful and
interesting conclusions made.<P>

The aim of this project is to act as an extension to the initial
benchmarking carried out and to investigate further how useful and
efficient the SR2201 actually is, in comparison to the Cray machines.
The proposal will be aimed at dividing the project into 3 parts with
an additional 4th, if time permits.<P>

The first of the stages involves extending the initial benchmarking
exercise to make use of 8 and possibly 16 processors (from Maidenhead)
which were not available before. The timings would be carried out on
the Hitachi SR2201 as well as both Cray machines. Also and only if
available, tuned BLAS routines for the SR2201 could be utilised and
compared with earlier results which made use of imported BLAS routines
from Netlib.<P>

The second of the stages would involve yet another benchmarking
exercise.  This time though, the aim would be to measure sustainable
memory bandwidth for the Hitachi SR2201. It would involve work with a
simple synthetic benchmark program, called STREAMS. The object of this
particular stage would be to carry out tests on the machine, in order
to measure its sustainable memory bandwidth and get the results
published on the STREAMS WWW pages.<P>

The purpose of the third stage would be to investigate the Parallel
FORTRAN Translator pf90. Everyone is well aware of the portability
of High Performance FORTRAN and the Hitachi SR2201 is no exception to
this. The machine does support this language, but so far, very little work
has been carried out. This would provide a useful opportunity to learn how
to program, compile and execute using HPF on the machine, as well as
determine how useful and efficient the translator is.<P>

A further fourth exercise could be tackled if the previous 3 stages
have been completed within the 8 weeks time frame. This would involve
further investigation into the use of faster communications on the
SR2201 machine.  Since SHMEM versions of ANGUS, CETEP and DL\_POLY
(ie. codes used in the initial benchmarking exercise) already exist,
these routines could be replaced with the concept of remote DMA
(Direct Memory Access). This is sender operated and directly transfers
memory, hence providing an opportunity to compare the use of it with
SHMEM calls.<P>
