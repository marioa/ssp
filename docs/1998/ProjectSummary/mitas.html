<H2>EPIC-2001: Extending EPIC to the Windows Desktop</H2>

EPCC's Interactive Courseware (EPIC) has been a highly successful and
visible component of the centre's educational activities.  It enables
browser clients to interact with installed packages on their own
machines through a mixture of Perl, CGI-bin executions and HTML.  This
has allowed nearly all of EPCC-TEC's course material to be provided as
an online distance learning resource.<P>

At the time EPIC was first designed, there was practiaclly no
alternative approach to achieve the same functionality.  Moreover, as
most of the applications and course material used by EPCC was
Unix-based (editors: vi, emacs; compilers: make and f90, etc) these
tools were built into the EPIC courses.  Clients were thus exclusively
restricted to being Unix based and this bias was exploited in EPIC's
Perl driver codes, particularly in the use of system calls to Unix
utilities and packages.  Also, the original design led to a protocol
whereby an EPIC command embedded in the HTML of an EPIC-friendly
course activated an EPIC task that could potentially be used to fire
up any desired (Unix) application.  This necessitated the use of
inelegant HTTP messages which had to be sent to the EPCC web server
and back to the client browser; undesirable for generating extra
communications but necessary to achieve the desired functionality.<P>

For the SSP-1997 programme, a project was undertaken to investigate
and rectify some of the above shortcominga, by rewriting the EPIC code
in Java instead of Perl.  This exploited the platform independence of
Java bytecodes, and the rich networking class libraries bundled with
the Java Development Kit.  This work led to the idea of using a proxy
server running on each client, which would intercept HTTP EPIC
requests to the EPCC web server, examine whether the request could be
handled locally (ie it is an EPIC command or a request for a web
page), and perform the required action locally.  This new design
removed the prior version's communications with the EPCC web server to
perform even the simplest EPIC command.<P>

The 1997 SSP project in turn led to the writing of the Java package
"EPIC-2001" by one of the project proposers, which contains a proxy
server class, and an EPIC specific layer.  This package has been
written to minimise the use of operating system specific function
calls, but as discussed above, is still limited by the use of Unix
applications by the EPIC courses themselves.<P>

It  is increasingly important for EPCC to be in a position to be able
to exploit new environments, such as  Windows 95/98 or NT, if it is to
be able to distribute its existing distance learning courses, and any
new  potential courses  (even Windows NT/95/98 specific  ones), to  as
wide a forum as possible.  Moreover making EPIC  available within this
mainstream  environment  would  enable  other university courses to be
ported to use the EPIC framework.  Currently there is  a  strong drive
within the University to provide electronic versions of taught courses
or even part of a distance learning package.<P>

The goals of this project then are mainly to investigate the use of
the PC environment for the running of EPIC.  In particular, it is
suggested that two of the existing EPCC-TEC courses are ported to work
on the PC environment using EPIC-2001.  These two proposed courses
are:
<UL>
<LI>MPI
<LI>Scientific Visualisation
</UL>

At one level, the availability of both MPI and AVS on the PC systems
should make this theoretically possible.  However, this is still not a
trivial conversion, in the sense that it would be disadvantageous for
the resulting product to be TOO dependent on Windows NT/95/98, but to
make use of Java wherever possible, and to isolate the operating
system-specific parts when not.  The issues addressed in this project
will be:

<UL> 
<LI>A portable method of replacing the Unix MAKE utility will have to
be found.  In EPIC this is used to compile codes, run codes, display
text output, display graphical output, etc.  The possibility exists
for replacing some of these with portable Java code.<P>

<LI>The system call to invoke the user's preferred text editor.  This
should either call a portable Java version, or be modified in order to
be less Unix specific.  One example being the use of tar files.<P>

<LI>Modify/extend the existing Graphical User Interface as is/may be
necessary.<P>
</UL>

It is hoped that by the end of this SSP project not only will we have
two of the current EPCC-TEC courses available within the PC
environment but also EPIC-2001 will be fully PC compliant enabling us
to port more, and create new courses that will work within this
environment.<P>
