<H2>Crystal Structure Determination from Powder Diffraction</H2>

In the past crystal structure determination from powder diffraction
has mostly involved highly symmetric inorganic systems and has had
limited application for organic molecules. This is primarily due to
the fact that whereas single crystal reflection intensities are
resolved in three dimensions in reciprocal space, powder diffraction
patterns contain the same intensity information projected in two
dimensions. The problems which arise include peak overlap (either
symmetric or accidental), large background intensities which cannot be
defined easily and prefered orientation.<P>

Advances in the hardware and software have however enabled the
structures of more complex systems such as
6,13-dichlorotriphendioxazine (Fagan, Hammond et al., 1995) and
phthalocyanine (Hammond, Roberts et al.,
1996) to be solved.<P>

The methodology which has been developed for solving crystal
structures from powder diffraction can be summarised as follows:<P>

1) Collection of high resolution powder diffraction data.<P>

2) Determination of the unit cell parameters and space group of the
crystal using a variety of programs.<P>

3) Determination of the molecular configuration of the molecules present
within the asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice.<P>

4) Determination of trial crystal structures for Rietveld refinement.<P>

5) Rietveld refinement (Rietveld, 1967) of the trial crystal structure.<P>

The determination of trial crystal structures for Rietveld refinement
has in the past led to serious problems. Rietveld refinement requires
a good realistic starting structure and hence considerable effort has
been applied to obtaining these starting structures.<P>

A systematic search algorithm (SNIFFER97) (Hammond, Roberts et al.,
1997) was developed as part of a collaborative research program with
Zeneca Specialities, Blackely. This systematically searches all the
possible packing configurations of the asymmetric unit within the
specified unit cell and assesses the lattice energy, powder
diffraction pattern and close contacts of each structure. It permits
the prediction of structural models for Rietveld refinement. This
systematic search algorithm deals with only one molecule within the
asymmetric unit, a limitation that forced the development of an
independent algorithm (compack1) to work in conjunction with the
systematic search algorithm (Smith, 1997).<P>

The method is however limited in accuracy due to computational
limitations.  Simple SNIFFER97 runs can involve searching millions of
configurations, a number that increases dramatically if torsional
effects are considered within the molecule and / or two molecules are
present in the asymmetric unit.<P>

This has led to larger step sizes being utilised and changes in the
molecular structure being ignored. Some examples where the limitations
have created a problem include SALOL (a pharmaceutical drug) and
rubidium dodecyl sulfate. Parallelisation of SNIFFER97 (and compack1)
would allow structures of complex systems to be solved which have not
previously been solved before. Hence this project would involve the
parallelisation of SNIFFER97 (using MPI) and if time allows of
compack1.<P>

The first task attempted by SNIFFER97 is a distance check on each
lattice configurations to obtain realistic structures. The distance
check on each configuration is independent of every other
configuration and hence the program is inherently parallel and a
parallel implementation should be relatively straight forward.<P>

Initially, a simple system already determined using the serial version
of the SNIFFER97 code will be utilised to ensure the parallel version
can successfully replicate the results (e.g. sodium dodecyl
sulfate). Following this a system which has previously failed to
determine any successful results due to time constraints will be
considered, this will most likely be SALOL.<P>

If time allows compack1 will be parallelised and a system which has
been determined using the serial code version will be utilised to
ensure reproducibility e.g. rubidium dodecyl sulfate. This system may
then be studied using a shorter step size and considering torsion
effects as this was known to be a limitation of the serial
determination.  Finally, (again if time allows) a system which has not
previously been studied, for instance that of catechol/urea complex
will be examined.<P>

Visualisation of these systems has previously been carried out using the
molecular simulation package Cerius2 (Molecular Simulations Limited). 
This however is an expensive package, and would not be purchasable. 
Should time constraint require, Heriot-Watt have two licences and the 
student could uses one of these across the network. However if time 
allows and interesting addition to this project would be for the 
student to attempt the visualisation using AVS.<P>
