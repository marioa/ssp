<H2>A Middleware Environment for Parallel Java on the Hitachi SR2201</H2>

<H3>1. Executive Summary</H3>
This document is a proposal for a summer student project concerned
with the Hitachi-EPCC collaborative Java project for the Hitachi
SR2201 distributed memory multiprocessor high-performance computer.
The aim is to produce a middleware which will allow the SR2201 to
operate as a compute-server in a commercial enterprise environment, to
which clients may submit their Java codes for improved execution.  The
need for such an environment comes from the strong adoption of
object-orientated technology (including Java-based technologies), and
the increasing prevalence of commodity PC desktop clients.  In such an
environment, there is assumed to be an established set of Java codes
which can be executed on desktops, but which would benefit from access
to a remote Java engine.  The use of Java is particularly notable for
this application as it has much of the machinery to allow distributed
object computing, as well as to send objects to remote recipients on
the network.  The successful completion of this project will provide
the student with a broad range of understanding to the current
state-of-the-art in Java-based distributed computing, and to the
project partners with a means of integrating the parallel Java for
SR2201 work into the commercial environment.<P>


<H3>2. Overview of the Hitachi-EPCC Collaborative Java Project for the
SR2201</H3>

In today's commercial enterprise organisations, one of the next major
technological waves will come from the use of distributed object
amongst existing client-server networks.  This observation comes from
the solid adoption of object-orientated technology in the commercial
environment, as exemplified by languages such as C++, Java and
Smalltalk, and the need to integrate the increasing expanse of PC
desktops amongst existing legacy systems.  The ongoing joint Hitachi
Europe Limited (HEL) and EPCC project is a direct reflection of this
perceived direction in computing deployment; it is an attempt to allow
the execution of multi-threaded Java programs on the Hitachi SR2201
distributed memory multiprocessor high-performance computer.  For the
successful completion of this project, the following technological
components need to be implemented:<OL>

<LI> A port of the Sun Microsystems Java Virtual Machine onto the SR2201.
<LI> Bindings through which Java programs can access the inter-processor communications susbsystem of  the SR2201.  In particular, this means the production of Java bindings to the existing 'C' MPI communications library on the SR2201.
<LI> The definition and implementation of a Java API library whereby programmers may write code which can run as separate threads in a distributed memory fashion over the processors of the target machine.  The aim is to have this library mask the use of MPI calls from the user, hence allowing the same Java code to be executed largely unchanged on a single-processor or even a shared-memory multiprocessor machine.
<LI> The definition and implementation of a middleware runtime environment whereby the user can execute Java bytecodes onto a remote SR2201 <I>compute-server</I> from a Java-compliant desktop client.</OL>
The first three items are currently in progress within EPCC, whilst the fourth will form the kernel of this proposed summer student project.<P>

<H3>3. Functional Requirements of the Middleware Environment</H3>
This environment has two components executing on the client and server
sides.  On the server-side running on the SR2201, a lightweight server
process will run which accepts and handles requests from a client.
These requests may be communicated either through the use of remote
method invocation (RMI) or sockets; the former would be more elegant
but may not be technologically feasible on the target platform, whilst
the latter needs slightly more elaborate codes but should be more
portable.  This compute-server executes compiled Java programs either
stored as a set of class libraries stored on its local filesystem, or
received remotely from authenticated clients.  The following
subsections group the functionalities required into three sets, with a
sketch of how they would be implemented on the client and server
sides; the technologies concerned are further elaborated in 4
below.

<H4><I>3.1  Services</I></H4> These functions   are concerned  with providing
information   between the client  and server,  regarding obtaining the
state, and   interactions with, the  compute  server.   <OL><LI> Query
status of the  target  compute-server, in   terms of processor   load,
available   processors,    memory,  and   temporary   disk  space.<BR>
<I>Server</I>: Use of Java  Native Invocation to interface between 'C'
system routines and  the   JVM.<BR> <I>Client</I>:  AWT for  the   GUI
display.<BR> <LI>   Control of the compute-server,   from interactions
with the client-side   GUI.  <LI> Report  back on  the status of   the
executions  on   the    compute-server  back   to  the     client.<BR>
<I>Server</I>: A  means of sending interrupt  signals to the executing
program on  the   compute-server.<BR>  <I>Client</I>:   Display status
results,  and   also allow  interruptions  to    the execution  on the
server.<BR>  <LI>  User authentication.<BR>   <I>Server</I>: java.security
package   for     public/private   key  authenticating    the  client.<BR>
<I>Client</I>:  java.security  package   for generating the   client's
authentication certificate.</OL>

<H4><I>3.2 Dynamic Class Loading</I></H4> One of the most exciting aspects of
Java technology is the ability to write agent programs which can be
migrated from one computer to another.  This is possible due to the
ability for the Java virtual machine to load in arbitrary classes at
runtime, to then instantiate them and execute the methods therein.
There are a few possible routes through which these classes can be
dynamically accessed, which the student should easily be able to
implement incrementally:<OL> <LI> Load a class from the
compute-server's local filesystem.  This approach has the obvious
benefit of being totally secure.<BR> <I>Server</I>:
java.lang.ClassLoader for the dynamic loading of classes.<BR>
<I>Client</I>: The appropriate interface from the GUI.<BR><LI> Load a
class from a network resource, via socket connection.<BR>
<I>Server</I>: java.lang.ClassLoader.<BR> <I>Client</I>: The
appropriate interface from the GUI.<BR> <LI> Load a class from a URL
resource.  Note that this is essentially what happens when an applet
is downloaded into a desktop browser, and should be a simple variation
of the socket connection case.<BR> <I>Server</I>:
java.lang.ClassLoader.<BR> <I>Client</I>: The appropriate interface
from the GUI.  <LI> Load a class via RMIClassLoader.  Here, RMI is
used instead of byte streams for loading in the remote class.  The
feasibility of this approach should be investigated, and can maybe
implemented independently of the use of RMI for the client-server
communications mechanism.<BR>  <I>Server</I>:
java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader.<BR>  <I>Client</I>: Necessary to write
client code for this use of RMI?  <LI> Load a class via the
transmission of an intermediate Java archive (Jar) file.  This has the
advantage of allowing several classes to be transmitted at once, but
needs deflation and inflation methods to be written at the client and
server ends.<BR> <I>Server</I>: Inflation of received Jar files, as
well as java.lang.ClassLoader.<BR> <I>Client</I>: Deflation of Jar
file, and GUI interface to transmit file to the server.
<LI>Verification of the loaded class.  It should not, for example,
over-ride any of the java.* classes held in the compute-server.<BR>
<I>Server</I>: Appropriate methods to check the namespace of the
loaded class is acceptable.</OL>

<H4><I>3.3 Invocation of Dynamically Loaded Classes for Serial
Execution</I></H4> Having dynamically loaded in the appropriate classes,
the compute-server now invokes the methods therein.  This is possible
if the target classes implement a pre-agreed interface.  This
interface will also reflect the parallelism execution of the classes,
but to start with will simply be the existing java.lang.Runnable
interface for the execution of serial programs.  In terms of
implementation, this will require the use of the instantiation methods
in the java.lang.Class and java.lang.reflect.Constructor classes.

<H4><I>3.4 Invocation of Dynamically  Loaded Classes for Parallel  Execution</H4></I>

<I>This will  depend on the  final   definition  of the distributed   parallel
threads library.</I>

<H3>4. Required Technologies for the Middleware Environment</H3>

This project will require the investigation and use of many
technologies, some of which are still in the process of being revised
(notably by Sun Microsystems' Javasoft division).  However, the
following technological pieces will almost certainly be used in this
project:<P>
<OL>
<LI> java.lang.ClassLoader for the dynamic loading of Java
classes.
<LI> Java Remote method invocation (RMI), for querying and
reporting back on the status of the SR2201 compute-server.
<LI> Java sockets and networking, should RMI prove unfeasible for the above
role.
<LI> Java native invocation (JNI), for accessing the 'C' native
functions on the SR2201.  Specifically, this would be for discovering
the state of the machine.
<LI> Java Beans.  The expected form for the Java objects which will be exported to the compute server is as a Java
Bean.  This has the attractive quality of a predefined interface
through which the middleware environment can query the state and
methods of the object.  <LI> Java archive format ('Jar' files) are a
means of packaging Java classes into one bundle which can then be sent
between machines for remote execution.  <LI> Java reflection APIs to
determine the properties of a Java class, including how to create one
of its instances.  <LI> Java object serialization.  This is the
mechanism whereby the state of an object (as defined by its
non-transient field variables) is packaged up to be sent to the remote
server.  Unfortunately, it currently cannot be used to export entire
objects (i.e., Java Bytecodes) and requires the serialized-class to be
within the Class search-path of the compute-server.  <LI> Implementation
of the launching of single and multiple Java Virtual Machines from the
SR2201, onto other processors.</OL>

<H3>5. Technical Questions Remaining</H3> Java is a complex
technology, in terms of the number of class libraries available to the
programmer.  Hence there are as yet some unanswered questions which
will have to be determined during the earlier phases of this summer's
project.  Some of these involve technical investigations of the Java
APIs, but others involve the basic design of the proposed middleware.
<OL><LI> The choice between Java RMI and sockets.  Extensive testing of the
Java RMI object request broker has not yet been performed for the
target compute-server.  <LI> Where should the remote classes be
accessed? The technologies listed in 3.2 contain options which may
be redundant, that is not all of them need to be implemented.
<LI> Definition of the parallel distributed threads library will need to
be finished prior to its invocation from this middleware.  <LI>
Determining how to package Java classes at runtime into Jar format,
for distributing between distributed machines.  The author has
verified that unpacking Jar archive files can be done from within the
existing 'java.util.zip.*' package APIs.</OL>

<H3>6. Workplan for the Middleware Environment</H3>
It should first be stated that all the
functionalities described in 3 are unlikely to be met at the first
iteration of the Middleware environment.  Instead, the architecture of
this middleware will be developed with the progression of the project,
as greater understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the
Java programming environment is made.  In particular, Java classes
will first be loaded dynamically.<P> In terms of the time available to the
summer student (10 weeks), the chronological steps for the writing of
the middleware environment may be listed as follows:<P><OL> <LI><I>(6-10th July)</I>
EPCC HPC courses, and familiarisation with the aims of the project.
<LI> Design for the compute-server, in particular whether it should use
RMI and/or network sockets for the client-server communications.
<LI> Write a server which is able to dynamically load, instantiate and
invoke objects stored on the server's local filesystem, include
limited security protection against hostile classes.  Extend the
server's classloader to obtain classes from remote clients.  Extend
the server to read in Jar files, to unpack & executes the classes
stored therein.  These Jar files should also contain a means of
defining the runtime environment, via serialized state information.
<LI>  Ascertain and implement available system calls to determine the
state of the compute-server.  <LI>  Design client functionalities,
including the GUI.  <LI> Write the server for interacting with the
compute-server.  Extend client to include the packaging of Jar files
to the server.  Bind interactions between the client and the
compute-server, via the client's GUI.  <LI> Implement security
authentication mechanisms between the client and the compute-server.
<LI> Extend the server for multiprocessor applications, as the master to
a set of slaves which is able to receive and handle their states, as
well as send signals to them.  <LI>  <I>(7-11th September)</I> Write report.</OL><P>
Steps (1) and (9) above are each fixed to one week's duration.  The
steps in between are deliberately ambitious to accommodate the skills
of the summer student, and written in rough order of importance to the
goals of the joint EPCC-HEL project.  How steps (2) to (8) are fitted
into the available eight weeks of the programme will be dependent on
the experiences of the student.<P>
