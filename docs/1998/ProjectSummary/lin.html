<H2>WebDB: Bringing Structure to the WWW</H2>

The World Wide Web owes its enormous success to its simplicity and
attractive user interface.  From the user's perspective it is becoming
increasingly sophisticated.  However, from the point of view of Web
authors, writing and maintaining a Web site is an arduous undertaking.
To use an analogy the current Web is at the level of assembly code -
all the links are hard coded and absolute, and this is at the heart of
why the Web is so difficult to maintain.<P>

Several tools exist to help write and maintain pages, but we suggest
that the problem, fundamentally, is that the wrong model is being
used.  What is needed is the Web equivalent of compilers or
interpreters to allow the construction of Web pages to take place at a
higher level.  To this end, we propose that the Web should be seen not
as a collection of files but as a structured storage and retrieval
mechanism - a database.<P>

This proposal is part of a new project being started at EPCC that
ultimately aims to develop a standard for the representation of Web
pages on a database.<P>

There are already many initiatives underway to interface Web servers
with databases.  This is not the same thing.  We are not trying just
to define an interface, we are trying to redefine the Web.  In a sense
the intention is to bring the WWW closer to its better designed, but
less popular, cousin Hyper-G.  Hyper-G is a much more sophisticated
distributed hypertext system.  It allows the same set of documents to
have different routes through them depending on the context they are
presented in, without having to modify the document source.  In a
chain of documents with forward and backward links, insertions and
deletions can be made in a single operation.  The database underlying
the system understands these structural aspects of the pages, so once
set up the author can let these happen automatically.<P>

In order to understand better what would be required of such a
database standard this project proposes to build a database from part
of the EPCC Web site.  It will contain staff bio pages, project pages
and EPCC library book pages linking all three together with cross
references.  Staff will be linked to projects they are managing or
working on and EPCC library books pages they have in their office.
Likewise those pages will in turn be linked back to members of staff.
The system will be designed to construct pages on demand from a Web
server (interpret the source) and to produce a static Web of the pages
(compile the source).  From the author's point of view it should have
an easy-to-use Web based interface, either through HTML and CGI or
through Java.<P>
