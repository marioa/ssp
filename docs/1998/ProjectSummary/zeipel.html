The aim of this project will be to develop a three dimensional model
for heat transport in sedimentary basins.  The key objective will be
to look at the impact of basement topography on the temperature and
thermal history of overlying sediments.<P>

Hydrocarbons (oil and gas) are produced when sedimentary rocks rich in
organic material (source rocks) are heated to high temperatures
(60-150 degrees Centigrade) for long periods of time (millions to tens
of millions of years).  This process of conversion from primary
organic material to hydrocarbons is known as maturation.  The accurate
assessment, and prediction, of the maturity and maturation history of
hydrocarbon source rocks is of great importance to the oil industry
when exploring for hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins like the North
Sea.<P>

The maturation history of a source rock depends upon its heating
history.  Temperature increases with depth of burial and vertical heat
conduction is the main control on the temperature structure of
sediments and the amount of heat supplied to source rocks.  It is
assumed that this is the only control on temperature variations in
standard, one dimensional models of source rock maturation.<P>

Rather than having a simple layered structure, as is assumed in one
dimensional basin models, it is clear that rifted sedimentary basins
have a complex structure and basement topography that varies in three
dimensions.  Faults can produce sudden steps in basement topography of
a kilometre or more that juxtapose high conductivity basement rock and
low conductivity sediments or even water.  Most hydrocarbon deposits
are found on basement highs and that is where most exploration wells
are drilled.  Present-day temperature and maturity data from these
wells are then used to constrain the thermal history of the downthrown
areas, where hydrocarbons are first generated before moving
(migrating) to the highs where they are concentrated and trapped in
structural culminations.<P>

In a one dimensional simulation no correction can be made for lateral
heat conduction or for the variation in thermal structure that is
likely to result because of basement topography.  The results of an
SSP project last year (<A
HREF="1997/ProjectSummary/carstens.html">
3D Modelling of Heat Flow in Sedimentary Basins </A> by Dirk Carstens)
have shown that heat flow is concentrated within basement highs due to
their higher conductivity.  This means that sediments overlying these
highs will have been more intensely heated than those in adjacent
lows.  Using maturity data from wells on the highs may therefore lead
to an overestimate of the maturity of source rocks in the main
downthrown "kitchen" areas.<P>

The principal objective of this study will be for the student to
develop a three dimensional model for heat transport.  They will then
use this model to test the impact of a range of basement topographies
and structures on the temperature structure of overlying sediments
using geologically appropriate rock properties.  The impact of having
a water-filled rather than sediment-filled basin adjacent to the
basement high will also be investigated.  Based on the experience of
Dirk Carstens, the objectives detailed above should be achievable
within the 8 week period available.  The project could be extended in
a number of ways.  This could be by looking at more detailed case
studies, and perhaps comparing model predictions to real values, or by
looking at the evolution through time of a single basement fault
block.<P>
