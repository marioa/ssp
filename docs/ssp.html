<H2><CENTER>The SSP in 2002</CENTER></H2>
</B></font>

<P>

Unfortunately, we have had to take the decision not to run the SSP in 2002, primarily
because we have started running an MSc course (October 2001). During the summer,  the
MSc students will be working on their projects, and we simply do not have  enough
staff time available to run both the SSP and the MSc projects during this period.

</P>

<P>

It is not clear whether we will be able to offer an SSP programme in the
future, please watch this space.

</P>

<H2><CENTER>What was the SSP?</CENTER></H2>
</B></font>

<P>

The Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP) was a unique training programme
in which senior undergraduates were employed to work on 10-week
projects investigating various aspects of high performance and/or novel computing
(HPC).

</P>

<P>

The programme ran for 9 years (1993-2001) and electronic versions of previous SSP
reports are still available for

<P>

The Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP) is a unique training programme
in which senior undergraduates are employed to work on 10-week
projects investigating various aspects of high performance and/or novel computing
(HPC).

</P>

<P>

The SSP is open <em>only</em> to undergraduates who have successfully completed <em>at
least</em> two years of an undergraduate degree in any subject with a <em>strong
emphasis on computer programming</em>.

</P>

<P>

The SSP is <em>not</em> usually open to postgraduate students although there may be
some <a href="#exceptions">exceptions</a> in the case of MSc students on taught
courses. Postgraduate research students from suitable backgrounds (see above)
interested in working in Edinburgh on short-term research visits should consider the
EU-funded TRACS Programme.  Details of this long-running programme can be found <a
href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/tracs">here</a>.

</P>

<P>

Any potential applicant not sure of their status in respect of the above conditions
should email us at <a href='mailto:epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk'>epccssp@epcc.ed.ac.uk</a>.

</P>

<P>

Successful applicants must attend the full 10 weeks of the programme. Students first
attend a one week formal training course and then work on an assigned project with one,
or sometimes two, supervisors. At the end of the period each project is written up in
a formal report.

</P>

<P>

During their stay the students are supported by grants from EPCC;
competition for places is fierce with approximately 50 applicants for the
available 12 spaces.

</P>

<P>

In 2001, 12 students from the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Slovenia, 
Spain, Ukraine and U.S.A. participated in the SSP.

</P>

<P>

The projects in 2001 included subjects ranging from OpenMP for
Java to more applied work such as Real World Machine Vision and 
Modelling of fracture growth in rocks.
Further
information about the 2001 projects and the final reports are
available from <A
href="2001/projects01.html">here</A>.

</P>

</P>

<P>

At SuperComputing 1994 a past co-ordinator of the programme presented a
paper describing in detail the operation of the programme. A copy of the
paper is available <A
