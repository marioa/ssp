A map is a collection of modules that have been linked together.
The links are represented by coloured pipes (either blue or purple),
and these pipes connect
the various input and output ports together. Maps are created so that
particular parts of the data are visualised in the required way.
In a sense it is like writing a programme (the map) to perform a
certain task, and creating this programme from a set of routines
(the modules).
Various maps have been created to carry out specific tasks. Those
relevant to visualising QCD data are to be found in the 
Librarian under Gauge and Meson, there
are others under maps in the librarian that are useful for
inspiration when creating maps.
<P>
To use a map drag it onto the Map Editor, the same as starting 
a module, and wait for it to load. When all the blue pipes 
(some pipes may be purple)
are in place the map is ready to be used. If some of the 
modules are flashing yellow wait until this has finished.
<P>
The following maps can be found in the <em>Meson</em> and <em>Gauge</em>
lists in the <em>Librarian</em>.
<DL ><DT>animation
<DD> has been set up to record snapshots of the
image in the render window for use in a movie. This map
should be used as a template for writing images of the form 
required. Once these images have been recorded there are
facilities called <tt>Movie</tt> and <tt>Movieplayer</tt> available on
SGI's which can be used to playback
the images.
<P>
<DT>contour
<DD> displays orthogonal contour slices.
<P>
<DT>displaceorthoslice
<DD> takes orthogonal slices (i, j or k axis)
or the image. It has also been set up to displace the image, place a wire
frame around the data set and place a legend in the render
window.
<P>
<DT>gaugeslice
<DD> displaces orthogonal slices along with a histogram
display showing the distribution of data. Again a legend is provided.
<P>
<DT>histogram
<DD> displays the distribution of data along with 
maximum and minimum values of the data.
<P>
<DT>isosurface
<DD> displays an isosurface (a 3-D contour).
<P>
<DT>orthoslice
<DD> displays orthogonal slices.
<P>
<DT>slice
<DD> can slice the data in any direction. Again this
comes with a legend.
<P>
<DT>splatter
<DD> renders a full volume display with an isosurface 
present (a 3-D contour).
<P>
<DT>volume1
<DD> renders a full volume display with legend.
<P>
<DT>volume2
<DD> renders an orthogonal slice of the data and an isosurface 
(a 3-D contour) in separate
render windows -
please note that isosurface can take time on large data sets.
<P>
<DT>volume3
<DD> renders an isosurface (a 3-D contour) and a histogram.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Specific ports have been disconnected on each map so that Explorer
does not begin loading in a file that does not exist, or begin a loop
which may take a long time to execute. Before connecting these ports 
it is advisable to check the information entered in the widgets on 
all modules and alter as appropriate, for example check the file
name in <tt>ReadQCD</tt> and <tt>Animfile</tt>, and the range of
any <tt>For</tt> module.
<P>
For use of the <b>animation</b> and <b>gaugeslice</b> maps
the following ports must be connected:
<P>
Connect <tt>Animfile</tt> input <em>value</em> 
to the <tt>For</tt> module output <em>current value</em> (to enable the for
loop to sweep through files). To activate the <tt>For</tt> module
connect <tt>Render</tt> <em>sync</em> output to the <tt>For</tt>
<em>condition</em> input.
<P>
For all maps <tt>ReadQCD</tt> needs to be connected to <tt>Animfile</tt>. 
To do this connect the output port <em>out file</em> on <tt>Animfile</tt>
to <em>input file</em> of the input port of <tt>ReadQCD</tt>. 
It is not necessary to use <tt>Animfile</tt>, the file name may be 
entered in directly in the <em>input file</em> section of <tt>ReadQCD</tt>,
however if many files are to be used which only differ by a number,
eg the timeslice, then <tt>Animfile</tt> reduces the entering of 
filenames. <tt>Animfile</tt> must be used if using a <tt>For</tt>
module to sweep through many files.
<P>
Please note that <tt>ReadQCD</tt> may still have to be connected. Where
not specified this involves connecting the output port of <tt>ReadQCD</tt>
to the input-lattice ports of <tt>orthoslice</tt> and <tt>maxmin</tt>.
<P>
Once the map is set up click on the square box at the top of 
the <tt>ReadQCD</tt> module, or if <tt>Animfile</tt> is present this
may be used instead. A window will appear (see figure <A HREF=subsection3_6_7.html#readdiag>5</A>.
<P>

<P>
Leave the scribe part of the window. Click the left mouse
button in the input part of the window and type in the path
for your file. If in doubt enter the full pathname.
Press <tt>return</tt>. If the module does not start to flash 
yellow within a few seconds click the right mouse button 
on the top part of the module and select <em>refire</em>.
<P>
Images are viewed in the <tt>Render</tt> module window. To enlarge
the window click on the square on the module with the left mouse button,
this is the same for all modules. The image may take a while to appear,
please be patient. They are various facilities within the <tt>Render</tt>
window. The best way to learn about these is by playing about
with them using a simple map and a small data set.
Holding the right mouse button down over the image will produce a menu.
The most useful facilities are in the option 
<tt>Functions</tt> are <tt>View all</tt>
which will home in on your image, <tt>Set home</tt> and <tt>Home</tt> -
these will set a position for your image which can be homed in on
if you lose the image. There is also a <tt>decoration</tt> option
which iconizes some of these facilities around the edges of the 
<tt>Render</tt> wondow.
For more details of these please refer to the 
Explorer manual <A HREF=bibliography3_10.html#helenmanualexplorerusers>[4]</A>
(see section <A HREF=subsection3_6_9.html#sectexplorerhelp>6.9</A>).
