To aid the user and to minimise the amount
of time spent entering information, part of the design of the
programme includes <em>styles</em> of filenames. This section will
contain a description of what is meant by a filename style and how to 
make best use of this facility.
<P>
This facility was designed around the way the filenames are
structured in the raw data files from the UKQCD simulations.
These files tend to be of the form 
<PRE><TT>
C60L4320L00    C62L4320L00    C64L4320L00
C60L4320L01    C62L4320L01    C64L4320L01
C60L4320L02    C62L4320L02    C64L4320L02     etc...</TT></PRE>
<P>
where <tt>L4320L</tt> relates to the pion mass.
<P>
There is an obvious underlying structure to this of
<P>
C &lt;<em>configuration</em>&gt; L4320L &lt;<em>timeslice</em>&gt;
<P>
When using the programmes in <tt>menu</tt> to extract the physical properties,
the base and extension tend to stay constant throughout a number of
executions, with either the first or second number altering.
It would therefore make sense to combine this into the programme
to free the user from entering filenames manually and being tied 
up during the execution of the programme.
<P>
For example, if the files are named as those mentioned above, 
the dialogue would be as follows:
<PRE><TT>
 You will be asked to enter in the input
    filenames in the following form:
     base   number1   ext   number2
  
 If you do not wish anything in base or 
  ext then simply press return and ignore it
 If it is a number category you do not 
  require then type -1
  
 the base 
C
 the first number of number1 (integer please) 
60
 the last number of number1 
64
 the step between the numbers (integer) 
2
 the extension 
L4320L
 the first number of number2
0
 the last number of number2 
2
 the step between the numbers 
1</TT></PRE>
<P>
This will produce the required filenames. For verification the 
filenames will be displayed as they are opened.
<P>
As mentioned in the above dialogue it is possible to vary the 
style of filenames by pressing <tt>return</tt> when prompted 
for a string and <tt>-1</tt> when prompted for an integer.
<P>
The best way to use this facility is always to have filenames in the form
of
<P>
&lt;<em>Base</em>&gt; configuration number &lt;<em>extension</em>&gt; timeslice number
<P>
to speed up the use of programmes and to avoid renaming files. For an
easy way of renaming files see section <A HREF=subsection3_4_6.html#sectshell>4.6</A> on shell scripts.
