<H2>EPCC Summer Scholarship Programme - Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

This page attempts to answer some of the most common questions that are asked by our applicants.<P>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>Who is eligible for the Summer
Scholarship Programme?</FONT><BR>

<UL><LI>Any <B>undergraduate</B> student from any part of the world,
who is studying a course with a strong emphasis on computing,
preferably students in their 3rd year of study or above, with
experience of project work.  <P>

<LI>Students working towards Master's degrees may apply in the following cases:
    <UL><LI>if the Master's degree is a first degree (e.g. M.Phys degrees)
	<LI>if the Master's degree is a <I>taught</I> postgraduate
course and not a research degree.  Additionally, the student should
have completed the Master's degree by the beginning of July.  Master's
degree students will not be accepted to come to EPCC to work on the
research component of their Master's qualification.</UL>

<P>    

<LI>Unfortunately, we cannot accept other postgraduate students (Ph.D
and similar).  However, European postgraduate students may be eligible
for the <A HREF="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/tracs">TRACS Programme</A>
instead.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>Do I need to have any previous experience of High Performance Computing?</FONT>
<UL><LI>No - all training will be provided.  However, strong programming skills in either C or Fortran <B>will</B> be required.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>What are the dates of the 2001 Summer
Scholarship Programme?</FONT><BR> <UL>
  
<LI>The 2001 Summer Scholarship Programme will begin on Monday 2nd
July and will end on Friday 7th September.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>Is it essential that I am there for the
full duration of this Programme?</FONT><BR>

<UL><LI>Yes.  The first week of the Programme is entirely filled by
training courses in High Performance Computing techniques.  Attendance
at these courses are compulsory for all students.  Similarly, the
final week is set aside for the writing of the project report.
Project proposals are created on the understanding that the student
will be working here for 10 weeks.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>When is the closing date for
applications?</FONT>

<UL><LI>The closing date for the SSP 2001 is Friday 16th February.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>What does the selection procedure
involve?</FONT>

<UL><LI>There are two stages of selection:
<UL><LI>Firstly, application forms are passed to EPCC staff for review.  The reviewers meet and select around 20-25 candidates for interview.
<LI>Interviews take place usually around the beginning of the University Easter holidays, at the end of March.  If you are not within easy travelling distance of Edinburgh, we will interview you by telephone.</UL>
Interviews take place over a two week period.  The interviewers then meet as soon as possible after the interviews to make the final selection.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>What sort of projects do students work on?</FONT>
<UL><LI>Previous years' projects are available from this site (see the top of this page for links).  There are a wide variety of projects, some being pure computer science and others being based on research in biology or geology, for example.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>Who proposes the project - the student
or EPCC?</FONT> 

<UL><LI>Project proposals are submitted by members of EPCC staff and
other researchers from the universities within Edinburgh.  They are
reviewed by a panel of EPCC staff and then a selection meeting is held
at which projects are selected according to their feasiblity.  The
meeting is held after the final selection of students, so that they
can be as closely matched as possible.  If an applicant has a special
area of interest then we will try to allocate a suitable project if
possible, but obviously no guarantees can be made.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>What kind of accommodation can be arranged for students coming from outside Edinburgh?</FONT>

<UL><LI>Each year we rent a 10-bedroom flat in postgraduate
accommodation on campus.  Each student has their own single study
bedroom, and there is a large communal kitchen/dining/living room,
with facilities for self-catering.  The accommodation is on the same
campus as EPCC and a 20 minute bus journey from the centre of town.
We find that the flat-sharing experience is usually a very positive
aspect of the Programme for those who stay there.</UL>

<FONT COLOR='#a51042' SIZE='3'>What about the social aspect of the Summer Scholarship Programme?</FONT>
<UL><LI>This is usually very good, and students usually make time to take a weekend or two travelling around the Scottish countryside.  To see what some of the previous students got up to, please follow this link: <A HREF="Misc/edinburgh.html">Amit's travel pages</A>
</UL>
