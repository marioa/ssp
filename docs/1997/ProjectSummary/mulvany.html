<H2>All the World's a Cube: Computational Fluid Dynamics on a Sphere
without Coordinate Singularities</H2>

The equations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are relatively
straightforward to solve on a parallel computer for the case of
steady-state, incompressible flow. For example, one of last year's SSP
students wrote an MPI CFD solver from scratch with no prior experience
of either CFD or parallel computing. Despite this, however, the
equations can still describe a wide range of interesting physical
phenomena.
<P>
Although the equations themselves are simple to discretise on a regular
grid, problems arise when a more complicated coordinate system is
required. The prime example is when a 2D problem is solved on the
surface of a sphere, for example to study global ocean properties (where
the finite depth of the oceans is ignored) or perhaps the formation of
Jupiter's red spot. The standard approach is to use a latitude /
longitude grid, but this leads to coordinate singularities at the poles.
This can be avoided by having two mutually rotated grids, one with its
coordinate poles at the physical North and South pole and the other with
its poles at the physical equator. However, this leads to problems of
marrying the two grids where they overlap and interpolating physical
quantities between them.
<P>
A radically new, but beautifully simple, solution was proposed by an
Italian group within the last couple of years. The sphere is mapped to a
cube which leads to surprisingly small distortion even at the corners of
the cube, and no singularities at all in the grid. The regularity of the
cube makes parallelisation remarkably simple and perfectly suited to
SIMD machines (the original target architecture) and, by analogy, HPF on
any architecture.
<P>
The project is therefore to write an HPF code that solves for the steady
state flow of an incompressible fluid on the surface of a sphere. There
will be extensive opportunity to perform visualisations of the resulting
velocity fields, perhaps using DIVE as and easy way of doing this in
real time.
