With the growth in size and importance of the Internet for academia,
industry and commerce, the problem of making the most efficient use of
the available bandwidth becomes more acute.  The problems of Internet
congestion are difficult to understand because of the large and highly
unstructured topology of the network, and the dynamic nature of its
operation.
<P>
EPCC is interested in applying the resources of High Performance
Computing to the task of simulating Internet traffic. This project
involves building a simulation model of a local area network and
investigating different possible caching schemes for users of
workstations on the network. It will use an existing simulation package
built by the Department of Computer Science (DCS) called HASE which
provides a simulation engine, graphical model building facilities, data
recording  and visualisation facilities. HASE runs on sun workstations
and has (apparently) been ported to the T3D.
<P>
The Hierarchical computer Architecture design and Simulation Environment
(HASE)allows for the rapid development and exploration of computer
architectures at multiple levels of abstraction, encompassing both
hardware and software. A computer network in these terms is considered a
generalisation of an architecture. Within HASE simulation objects are
called entities. The package includes graphical entity design and edit
facilities, entity library creation and retrievalmechanisms,ananimator,
and statistical analysis and experimentation tools for deriving system
performance metrics. 
<P>
The LAN chosen for study is the DCS network which involves
interconnected ethernets linking over 200 machines this is then
connected to the FDDI ring at of EdLan the University network.
<P>
The work will involve the following steps
<UL>
  <LI> learn the HASE++ simulation language (build simple examples based on
Message Passing course ideas, ping-pong, task farm, client server)</LI>
  <LI> build a model describing the transfer of HTTP packets across
ethernet</LI>
  <LI> write HASE classes to describe browsers, web servers and web
caches</LI> 
  <LI> profile traffic on the CS network</LI>
  <LI> build the model of the CS network</LI>
  <LI> validate the model against the profiling statistics</LI>
  <LI> running experiments involving placing webservers in of different
sizes, in different places of the network</LI>
  <LI> write a report</LI>
</UL>
The intention is that the student work on an incremental construction of
a simulation model. The modelling language HASE++ is part of the HASE
package and specifically tailored to discrete event simulation. The
student will start by building a simple ping-pong model with a ping
class that generates packets, a pong class that receives packets and
bounces them back and a network package that connects the two. In the
first instance the network package will be a vanilla network that passes
the message along with just a short delay. The ping pong exercise can be
built on to construct a task farm model and a multiple-client,
single-server model.
<P>
With some familiarity with the modelling language the student should be
ready to develop the vanilla network model to an ethernet model which
incorporates contention and bridges. The earlier message passing
examples should also work on this network description. The next stage
would be to develop the client/server model constructed earlier to model
browser requests and web server replies. A hybrid of the browser and
server descriptions can then be used to construct a web cache
description. These stages will involve a number of decisions about the
what are the most important aspects to model.
<P>
Once the model descriptions of the network and the packet generators and
sinks are in place. The next stage is to look at the particular network
to be modelled. The DCS network has been chosen because it is large
enough to have a non-trivial topology, but small enough and accessible
enough that a reasonably realistic model of it should be realisable in a
short period of time. Constructing a model that reflects the topology
can be done using the graphical front end to HASE. However  topology is
not the only aspect that is important, it would also be useful to model
the background activity. This can be measured by placing collecting logs
of the distribution of ethernet packets, the number of collisions etc.
that occur.  The simulation model once built then needs to be run and
tested validated against the real data collected from the network.
<P>
The final part to the project is to carry out an experimental
investigation placing one or more Web caches at different points in the
network and comparing the relative performance under different
conditions.
<P>
There are a number of possible extensions to the project  including a
comparison of  the new HTTP standard with the old (under some
circumstances a two fold increase in speed is claimed). The network
model could also be extended to take in part of the FDDI ring.
<P>
The project report would examine the modelling challenges and trade-offs
that needed to be made, and present the conclusions of the experimental
study.
