The proposed project follows on from the 1996 SSP project "MPI Datatypes
Toolset" undertaken by Werner Augustin [see EPCC-SSP-96-10 "MPI
Datatypes Toolset"]. Last year's development was concentrated on
construction of a parser tool that would automatically take marked C
structs and Fortran COMMON blocks and generate the MPI code necessary to
create portable MPI derived datatypes to match the marked program data.
<P>
Another area that was partially addressed in last year's work was the
provision of library support for creation of MPI derived datatypes that
match commonly used program structures. Werner achieved some success in
developing library support for the packing and unpacking of recursive
data structures such as trees and graphs, using information planted by
the datatype parser.
<P>
The proposed follow-on project will primarily address the following
goals:
<UL>
  <LI> library support for defining MPI derived datatypes to match regular
program data structures;</LI>

  <LI> library support for defining MPI derived datatypes to match F90
array sections / HPF decompositions;</LI>

  <LI> generalisation of library support for MPI transfer of recursive
program data structures;</LI>

  <LI> portable representation of MPI derived datatypes for visualisation /
debugging;</LI>

  <LI> visual construction of MPI derived datatypes, automatic generation
of MPI code;</LI>

  <LI> extension / enhancement of MPI Datatypes Toolset parser: editor
mode? web service?</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The initial goal will be in provision of library support for creation of
MPI derived datatypes to match commonly-seen regular data structures.
The following code fragment illustrates how a new routine, analogous to
the MPI Process Topologies routine MPI_Cart_sub might be used to define
a suitable derived datatype. A subtlety here is that for the datatype to
be composed by MPI comms calls the extent has to be set explicitly,
requiring calls to MPI_Type_vector, MPI_Type_struct and understanding of
the predefined "datatype" MPI_UB.

<TT>      dims(2) = J</TT><P>
<TT>      dims(3) = K</TT><P>
<TT>      remain(1) = .FALSE.</TT><P>
<TT>      remain(2) = .TRUE.</TT><P>
<TT>      remain(3) = .FALSE.</TT><P>

<TT>C.....Send y-columns 4,5,6,7</TT><P>
<TT>      call MPI_SEND(data(1,4,1), 4, columntype, dest, tag, comm, ierr)</TT>
<P>
MPI point-to-point and collective communications using derived datatypes
with identical composition but different layout allows combined data
transfer and re-mapping.
<P>
Use of MPI in Fortran 90 programs is an area of concern: there are some
serious incompatibilities between F90 and MPI. Perhaps the most major
problem is the interaction between the F90 copy-in copy-out mechanism,
for passing non-contiguous program data, and MPI non-blocking calls. An
important example of non-contiguous data that requires a copy into a
temporary lasting only for the duration of the call is an array section,
eg.  data(1,4:7,1). A generalisation of the routine suggested in the
example above would allow an alternative, passing the full array and a
derived datatype giving the layout of the array section to the
non-blocking call, so avoiding the copy-in copy-out.
<P>
Another possible application of this kind of library support would be to
define derived datatypes matching the local part of global data
distributed by HPF directives, allowing hybrid programs that take
advantage of  some standardised data-parallel and message-passing
features.
<P>
There is a strong opportunity for the latter parts of this development
to be driven by the needs of other SSP projects, perhaps combined with a
more wide-ranging survey of data structures used in parallel
applications.
<P>
The current MPI-2 draft standard specifies calls to obtain exact
information on how a given derived datatype was constructed.
Standardisation of this functionality offers a portable method of
visualising or debugging the derived datatypes in an MPI program, either
during or after execution. Two tools that might be of use, given a
standard file format for the structure of MPI derived datatypes: during
execution the user program identifies send and receive datatypes, the
user can later verify that the type signatures matched, as required by
the MPI standard; the user program identifies a derived datatype,
allowing later visualisation of its layout and fundamental (basic)
datatypes, perhaps superimposed on an independent abstract description
of the program data to which the datatype is applied. 
<P>
There is also scope for development of code resulting from the 1996 MPI
Datatypes Toolset project. The provision of library support for abstract
communication of recursively structured data can be divorced from the
parser tool by providing an alternate interface requiring user callback
routines to identify linked items. The parser itself, though complete
and tested, can be used as a component in other systems. For example one
could provide an editor mode that parses marked data structures, or a
service which parses submitted program fragments submitted though WWW
forms. There is wide direction and applicability in providing support
for MPI derived datatypes which can easily be tailored to the skills and
interests of the student.
