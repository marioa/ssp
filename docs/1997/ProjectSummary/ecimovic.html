This project aims to decouple a run time visualiser from a core MPI
application to increase its portability across MPPs. The visualiser will
still be available but the core application will subsequently
communicate with the visualiser via a sockets interface. The core
application will then run on any MPP or NOWs while the display can be
done at run time potentially on a separate graphics work engine. The
resulting code will subsequently be used to perform a calculation
investigating the material behaviour of discrete particles under shear.
This will make a significant contribution to a major existing
international collaborative project. This project has already received
widespread acknowledgment with almost 50 submissions to date and 120
interested research groups from academic and commercial institutions all
over the world. This submission will be one of only two performed on a
highly parallel machine. Preliminary findings from the submissions
previously received were recently reported at a major international
conference in Prague (CHISA `96).
<P>
The core application at the heart of this proposal models the discharge
of particles from a silo using a discrete element model. The serial code
was originally written by Graham Rong from the department of Civil
Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. The code was subsequently
parallelised by Thomas Schroder during the 1995 SSP. The visualiser,
which uses a combination of Motif and OpenGL to do the drawing, was
later added by EPCC members of staff so that the application might serve
as a demonstrator for Digital at Super Computing 1996 in Pittsburgh,
USA. The code is currently being developed as one of EPCC-TEC's parallel
application demonstrators which will show source portability and
scalability across a range of different platforms.
<P>
In its present state the visualiser code, written in C, and the core
application written in Fortran are tightly coupled within the same
application. The MPI program allows one process exclusively to run the
visualiser while the  remaining processes run the Fortran code. This
assumes that cross calling between C and Fortran using MPI calls works -
this is not mandated by the present version of the MPI standard albeit
some implementations do appear to support this across the same platform,
e.g. MPI-CH. This then potentially reduces the portability of the
present version of the code. Moreover not all systems will allow a
visualiser to be run directly off the machine, e.g. the Cray T3D. It
would thus be of great benefit and greatly increase the application's
portability if the visualiser and core application could be decoupled.
The core MPI application would thus run on the target machine and
communicate with the visualiser, which need not be on the same machine,
using Unix sockets. The visualisation environment could advantageously
be a dedicated visualisation system. For instance within the EPCC
framework the application could be run on the Cray T3D and the run time
visualiser could be run on the SGI Indigo2 High Impact machine, sphene.
<P>
The mechanism for achieving the decoupling already exists. The
underlying sockets library to be used was developed by Klass Jan
Wierenga for the 1996 SSP Dive project. [It would not be desirable to
use Dive directly as this presently coupled to AVS as the underlying
visualiser (which is not cheap nor universally available) hence not
really increasing the codes portability. It may be possible to decouple
AVS but this would require too much work]. It may also seem a little
crazy to use sockets when MPI is available!! HOWEVER in most cases it is
not be possible to use the same MPI implementation at the visualiser and
MPP end, e.g. the Cray T3D and the graphics  SGI system. Thus the same
sockets library as used within Dive would be taken as the starting point
for achieving the connection between the visualiser and the core MPI
application. This library has already been shown to establish lines of
communication portably across a whole range of systems (Cray J90-Sun
work station, Cray T3D-Sun workstation, Cray T3D-SGI, etc.). This
library would thus be used to decouple the core MPI application from the
visualiser. The portability of the code can be further increased by
ensuring that the socket routines used are implemented through a
software interface. The socket library thus will not be accessed
directly. Hence if the sockets communications interface is not available
for a given platform to which the application must be ported to in the
future then the underlying routines can be rewritten without having to
modify the application or the visualiser. Alternatively if X, OpenGL and
Motif are not available under a given system then the visualiser could
be rewritten without having to modify the core application.
<P>
The subsequent runs, of interest to the Civil Engineering department,
will be performed by the SSP student using the existing code, although
some minor modifications may have to be made. These may consist of the
numerical simulation of a shear box test using the discrete element
method (DEM) but is dependant on the amount of code modification
required. I have been assured that it should be possible to do this with
the existing code. The behaviour of granular materials, such as those
stored in silos, has been investigated for more than two hundred years.
However, the basic physical understanding of granular media is far from
complete. No general theory for the mechanics of granular materials
exists to date, and numerical simulations seem to be a promising
technique to obtain further insight into their dynamics. These
simulations can be used to assist in the development of strategies for
storage device design. In this project a notional material will be
filled into a box and consolidated.The frictional properties of the
particles will then be estimated by shearing the material under an
applied compressive stress.
