This project is a proposed followup to the 1996-97 collaborative work
between EPCC and the Department of Geology and Geophysics here at the U
of E.
<P>
The physical problem is the calculation of the flow of geomagnetic
fluids at the Core-Mantle Boundary based on measurements of variations
in the Earth's magnetic field at the surface. Various models exist to do
this, one of which is implemented in the ITERTRAN code. 
<P>
A key feature of these calculations is the use of spherical harmonic
expansions for the solutions to the differential equations (differential
equations on a sphere yield spherical harmonic solutions). Computations
are performed in terms of degrees and orders of associated Legendre
polynomials rather than spatially-distributed field solutions. 
<P>
Part of the previous work was the introduction of a spherical transform
method into the existing ITERTRAN code, to perform intermediate
transformations from the spherical harmonic space to a spatial grid upon
which the solution can be integrated numerically. 
<P>
Two options for parallelising the ITERTRAN code were considered: a
domain decomposition of this intermediate spatial grid, or a task-farmed
approach over independent timeslices at a higher level of the code.
<P>
It is proposed that this project investigate the implementation of one
or both of these parallel models, either separately or in combination.
Initially it is expected that the task-farmed approach over timeslices
will prove most effective, although the parallelisation benefits for the
spatial grid will rise for problems involving higher spherical harmonic
truncation levels.  It should prove interesting to investigate the
interaction of these two complementary approaches to parallelisation.
<P>
The primary goal would be a task-farmed implementation based on MPI.
<P>
Additional goals would be an independent domain-decomposition version
and a version that coupled the two approaches.
<P>
A possible further extension is the investigation of the use of a
data-parallel approach to the domain decomposition version.
