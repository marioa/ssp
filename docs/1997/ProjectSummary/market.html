Simulating the  dynamics of diseases provides a means of understanding
their spread through a population. Whilst the model to describe the
effect of diseases on isolated populations is generally accepted, such
types of populations no longer exist in the modern world. This has lead
to a growing interest in the spatial aspects of disease dynamics. 
<P>
Models have been developed to look at the effect of small numbers of
infectious individuals moving between sub-populations of the main
population group. However due to computational limitations, the number
of sub-populations which it is possible to look at is small (~10). With
this small number of sub-populations, unrealistic features are observed,
e.g., synchronisation between sub-populations leads to the disease dying
out, which does not occur in the real world.
<P>
The aim of this project is to develop an MPI version of one of the
simpler models of disease dynamics, with the aim of modelling a larger
number of sub-populations. The model to be used is the SEIR
(Susceptable, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. This model divides
the population into 4 groups:
<UL>
  <LI> susceptible: people who can catch the disease.</LI>
  <LI> exposed: people who are infected but not yet infectious.</LI>
  <LI> infectious: people who are capable of spreading the disease.</LI>
  <LI> recovered: people who are immune to the disease.</LI>
</UL>
Members of the population enter into and leave the simulation (i.e., are
born and die), and also move between the different groups. By modelling
the flow of the population between the different groups over a period of
time, the spread of disease can be monitored. To simplify the
simulation, it will be assumed that the disease in the simulation is not
fatal, so that the disease does not influence the death rates. In
addition, we assume that the birth and death rates are equal so that the
population size remains the same. 
<P>
The population is divided into a number of sub-populations which live on
the computation grid. A stochastic model will be used to implement SEIR
by generating events probabilistically across the grid. The result of
these events are used to update the values of the different groups. For
example, if a birth occurs the number of people susceptible to the
disease would increase by one. 
<P>
In part this project is a reworking of a previous SSP project
(EPCC-SS95-05) implemented on the CM-200. While the program developed in
the previous project is unlikely to help with the proposed project, the
student considered many aspects of the parallelisation which are
relevent to this project. Thus an MPI implentation should be relatively
straight forward, and it is expected that the student will implement
additional features which were not included in the original project such
as extending the sub-population interactions beyond nearest neighbour. 
<P>
In addition to developing the an MPI implentation of the stochastic SEIR
model, DIVE will be used to visualise the results, and hopefully a video
produced of the simulation.
<P>
The work proposed in this project will form the basis of an application
demonstrator to illustrate the application of HPC in this area, and is
part of the EPCC-TEC project CACHE.
