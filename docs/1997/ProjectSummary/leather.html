<P>
In the power utilities and the oil and gas industry, networks of
turbines or compressors are used to maintain a fluid or gas flow through
a system at a specific rate.
<P>
These compressors must undergo off-line maintenance to ensure they
continue to operate without catastrophic failure.  Generally there is
a maximum period after which the compressor must be taken off-line for
maintenance or else it is liable to catastrophic failure.
<P>
The purpose of this SSP is to discover the most appropriate operation
schedule for such a networks of compressors.  The schedule should
minimise maintenance costs whilst maintaining flow at the desired rate
through the system.
<P>
Different optimisation techniques will be used to find an optimal
maintenance schedule for the compressors.  The quality of the
solutions from the different techniques will be compared to determine
if the effort in using a particular technique is worthwhile.  The
optimisation techniques to be used are genetic algorithms, simulated
annealing, random search and hill-climbing.  These will be coded using
RPL2, a language for programming optimisation problems in terms of
genetic algorithms.  The other techniques to be investigated can also
be programmed using RPL2.
<P>
The constraints to the problem are the flow rate the network of
compressors must maintain and the maximum number of days between
services for a compressor.  In the first instance a very simple
network of 3 compressors would be used.  The resulting schedule should
define the output from a compressor for each day of a 28 day month.
For each day of the schedule, the combined output from the compressors
should match the required flow rate.
<P>
A naive solution is available to compare the results against.  This
naive solution consists of one more than the minimum number of
compressors necessary to maintain the flow, where the compressor
off-line for maintenance is always rotated.
<P>
Once the framework for finding solutions has been formulated, the
analysis could be made more sophisticated by incorporating fuel costs
into the problem. These compressors require fuel to run and generally
have a range of operational parameters over which they operate most
efficiently and use the least fuel.
<P>
Further sophistication could involve incorporating variable
maintenance costs where the longer a compressor has been in continuous
operation the longer off-line maintenance period and hence the dearer
the maintenance costs.
