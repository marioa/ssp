The EPIC system has been widely used to provide access to EPCC's
training materials, both internally (for TRACS visitors, staff
development or classroom teaching) and externally (EPIC exists in the
public domain, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet). EPIC has
been met with a very positive response and provides access (both local
and remote) for all EPCC's training materials. However, as training
needs change and web technologies develop EPIC faces being left behind
in exploiting the huge possibilities for collaborative learning. 
<P>
This project proposes to extend the learning potential of EPIC through
extensive use of Java technology (moving to EPIC 2000). In making this
move, it is hoped that three things will be accomplished: EPIC's current
functionality would be implemented in Java with a considerably
simplified and more efficient implementation, the resulting system would
be platform independent and so open up a huge potential for wider
exploitation of the EPIC infrastructure and finally it would attempt to
enable EPIC to make best use of developing technologies, such as Java
systems for collaboration (e.g. NCSA Habanero). All of these aspects to
the project would produce a considerable amount of "future proofing" to
EPIC, keeping EPCC's training provision at the leading edge.
<P>
As it stands, EPIC is a collection of simple Perl scripts, combined with
various UNIX applications. The initial stage of the project would be a
reimplementation of the core functionality of EPIC in Java, with a view
to collaborative learning extensions. This basic functionality includes
the ability to edit, execute (restricted) local shell commands, tailor
the client configuration and access remote course materials (via
internet protocols). This Java implementation would be completely
self-contained (including console and command windows, with a default
Java editor provided), and an essential part of the project is to
produce a PC compatible package. In addition is would be preferable if
much of the existing EPIC courseware could be adopted with little or no
change to work with this Java implementation.
<P>
<B>Implementation:</B><P>
At present, EPIC relies on the "helper application"/"remote viewer" mode
of use.  EPIC 2000 based on this model would be the simplest to
implement - simply rewriting the client side scripts in Java.
<P>
However, such a model suffers from unnecessary network traffic - with
connections to a distant server. A more suitable model would be to
extend EPIC to make use of a "surrogate server", which would run a
lightweight (Java) server on the local machine, which would serve the
EPIC requests in addition to executing the EPIC actions. Java is ideally
suited to such an implementation (Java based servers exist) and this is
the preferred model for this project, as is illustrated below:
<P>
<B>Design:</B><P>
Clearly there are a number of issues in the design of this application.
It is essential that the student be involved in this design process. In
preparation however, a number of pieces of related software will be
collected to act as a starting point for the project.
<P>
<B>Further Work:</B><P>
Many tools exist to facilitate collaborative learning, with the number
and range of these hugely expanded since the rise of Java. These include
systems for one-to-one talk sessions, chatrooms, and whiteboards. An
emerging infrastructure for many of these is provided by NCSA's Habanero
system. This consists of a collection of Java class libraries which can
be used to produce collaborative learning structures. With EPIC 2000
written in Java, it is hoped to be able to buy into the Habanero
technology to extend EPIC beyond solitary learning. Other scope includes
integrating EPIC with the HotJava browser in a single package and also
providing EPIC as a Netscape plug-in.
