Particle Image Velocimetry is an experimental technique for fluid flow
measurement. It involves three main steps: illuminating a seeded fluid
flow with a stroboscopic laser light sheet; photographing the flow using
suitable shutter timing; and analysing the digital image. Most flow
measurement systems give a single point measurement (eg hot wires, or
propeller flowmeters). The unique capability of the PIV system is that
the digital photograph may be divided up into a number of small areas,
which are independently analysed, and the returned vectors represent a
complete record of the velocity over the field of view at an instant in
time. 
<P>
Until recently 'wet' photography was the preferred medium for PIV due to
its high resolution. The wet film had to be developed and digitised; and
this was a major bottle neck in analysis of flow. However there are now
cameras with up to 4Mbyte of pixels available (eg the Kodak Magaplus),
and the digitised images are captured in a matter of tenths of seconds.
The analysis then takes c. 30 minutes per image on a serial machine.
<P>
The purpose of this project is to parallelise the analysis. The
programme must read a bitmap, divide it into appropriate small images,
and carry out 2D transforms and peak-finding algorithms to provide an
array of vector values. These are returned with ancillary data, such as
signal to noise ratios. The programme must also read in the parameters
for analysing the data, and print out all of the information in an
appropriate format.
<P>
The bulk of the project is relatively straight forward, in that the
problem is naturally adapted to parallel architectures. The procedures
carried out in each processor are independent, thought during the
partition of data, the programme will have to cope with non-integer
division of data fields.
<P>
On successful completion of the main part of the project there is scope
for extension. The adjacent (x and y) vector values should be compared
with each other for similarity, and rogue vectors deleted and replaced.
Ideally the programme would also operate as a batch processor.
