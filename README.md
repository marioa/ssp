# EPCC Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP)

The Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP) was ran by EPCC for 9 years (1993-2001)
and was terminated when EPCC started running an MSc in HPC. The main EPCC web
site has gone through a number of changes and the SSP content was lost but I
kept a copy and thought that it would be worthwhile providing a snapshot of 
the content as a historical artefact.
