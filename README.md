# EPCC Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP)

The Summer Scholarship Programme (SSP) was a unique training scheme;
since its inception in 1987, more than 150 senior undergraduates were
employed to work on 10-week projects looking at various aspects of
High Performance Computing. In 1996 the SSP involved 15 students from 9
different countries; Albania, Canada, France, Germany, Holland, Poland,
Portugal, UK and USA.

These are the web pages of the Programme ran by EPCC that record 9
years (1993-2001) of the Programme.  The SSP was discontinued in
2002 when EPCC started running an MSc in HPC. The main [EPCC web
site](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk) has gone through a number of changes
and the SSP content was lost but I kept a copy and thought that it
would be worthwhile providing a snapshot of the content as a
historical artefact.  Most of the internal links should still work
but a lot of the links pointing to other sites will have gone, e.g.
a student pointing back to their home page at their home institution
that has long gone.
